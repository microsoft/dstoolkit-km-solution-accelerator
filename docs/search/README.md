# Azure Cognitive Search (ACS)

ACS is at the core of this Knowledge Mining accelerator. It provides the necessary search and exploration features to the solution. 

# Architecture 

![Search Architecture](../architecture/Search_Architecture.png)

# Ingestion

This accelerator is configured to ingest data from an Azure Storage Data Lake. By default your data pushed to the **documents** container.

| Container | Description | Is indexed ? |
|--|--|--|
|**documents**|where you would push your data|Yes|
|**images**|Where converted pages/slides & attachments are extracted|Yes|
|**metadata**|Where we stored all documents full metadata output and an HTML representation of a document.|No|
|**translation**|Where we stored all translated documents.|Yes|
||||

# Search Configuration

All search configuration is JSON-based organized in folders

![](media/Configuration.png)

Adding a new search index or datasource is as simple as dropping a new JSON file in the corresponding folder and run the following. 

A quick table to understand the relationships between all Search components. 

| Storage Container | Datasource(s) | Indexer(s) | Skillset(s) | Description | Since Version |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| documents | documents | documents | documents | Index all types of documents except images files (extension exclusion configuration) | v1.0|
| documents | documents | docimg | images | Index all images files from the documents container (extension inclusion configuration)| v1.0|
| images | images | images | images | Index all images files located in the images container.| v1.0|
| translation | translation | translation | documents | Index all translated documents files located in the translation container.| v1.1|
| images | images | attachments | documents | Index all attached documents files located in the images container. This case allows Emails' attachments indexing for instance.| v1.1|
||||||

All search components in the Azure portal are prefixed with the configuration name parameter used as a prefix for all deployed services. 

__Example of indexers prefixing__
- {{config.name}}-documents
- {{config.name}}-docimg
- {{config.name}}-images
- {{config.name}}-translation
- {{config.name}}-attachments

To connect and operate your ACS instance, you would initialize your environment. 

```ps
cd deployment
./init_env.ps1 -Name <envid>
```

To configure your search instance initially or after modifications, run the below cmdlet

```ps
Initialize-Search
```

**Initialize-Search** will re-apply all existing configurations. If you need targeted updates, please refer to the below commands 

- Update-SearchAliases
- Update-SearchDataSource                          
- Update-SearchIndex
- Update-SearchIndexer
- Update-SearchSkillSet
- Update-SearchSynonyms                              

# Enrichment concepts  

## Use of Apache Tika 2.x

Apache Tika 2.x provides great content analysis capabilities like : 

- Supports a wide range of [document formats](https://tika.apache.org/2.4.0/formats.html) 
- Extract Metadata
- HTML Conversion
- Text Extraction
- Extract Table of Contents, Annotations (PDF)
- Images Extraction

[and more...](https://tika.apache.org/)

We use a custom version of Tika to natively support Azure Storage to ease data transit and processing. 

## Extracting images from documents (Tika-based)

The technology we use to extract images from documents is provide by a custom Apache Tika version. 

While Tika can extract embedded images from any Office or PDF documents, in practice it leads to have many images not giving much value i.e. logos, backgrounds etc. 

Also annotations overlapping images in documents or any graphical element are lost. This is mostly seen & common in PDF. 

For this solution, by default, we chose to extract as follows
- each PowerPoint slide into an image
- each PDF page into an image

Each page/slide image is then indexed as an individual item allowing end-users to target & retrieve specific slide or page. You don't have to scroll any big PDF to find where your search query was matched.  

This choice provides more user experience capabilities like document cover, thumbnails or tables extraction to name a few.

There is another aspect of doing your own images extraction is cost. In Azure Cognitive Search, Images extraction is [a paid feature.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/)

## Email's Attachments 

Emails processing falls under the documents processing to the exception that extracted "images" here known as attached documents will need specific indexer.

Starting with V1.1, we do now support attachments indexing.

## Translation

The entire solution is configured to normalize content to a parametrable language option named **searchDefaultToLanguageCode** defined in the search/config.json. By default it set to English. 

### Text Translation
Each textual content whether it is coming from the text extraction of a full document or the OCR outcome of an image is translated to English (default but configurable). 

On non-native English documents, the Transcript tab  will show a side-by-side translation. 

![Translation](../ui/media/details/Transcript2.png)

### Document Translation

We added support for Document Translation in our solution. A translation container is created automatically to receive translated documents. Document Translation

![Translation](../ui/media/DocumentTranslation.png)

## Document Processing 

The below diagram highlights the document processing flow. 

![Document Processing](media/Document_Processing.png)

Out of processing a document it produces images (pages/slides) but also extract embedded objects such as emails' attachments.

## Image Processing

The below diagram highlights the image processing flow. Note that once the text of an image is extracted the same document processing will apply against it.   

![Image Processing](media/Image_Processing.png)

## Audio & Video

You may extend the solution to include Audio and Videos processing. 

# Azure Cognitive Search Skills

Below the list of custom functions supporting skills

| Skill | Description | Language | 
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Entities | Utility skill to deduplicate, clean, concatenate entities | C# |
| Geo | Skill to assign a country, city, capital & other locations from a list of locations | C# |
| Image/Extraction| Skill to trigger the images extraction on documents | C# |
| Language | Single Skills to interact with Azure Cognitive Services Language : TextAnalytics, Translator| Python |
| Metadata/Assign | Skill to combine all metadata assignments in terms of metadata, security or anything you'd want.| C# |
| Metadata/Extraction | ACS provide a set of common properties for any file. This skill will provide you with the entire set of metadata a file has. It is based on Apache Tika| C# |
| Text | Skill to manipulate textual data|  C# |
| Vision | Single Skills to interact with Azure Cognitive Services Vision : Analyze, Computer Vision, Form Recognizer|  Python |

To support some content analysis skills like Image & Metadata extraction, we deploy a docker-based Tika server.
The container service we used is Azure App Service. For Production use, we would recommend Azure Kubernetes.

A function could host one or more skills. 

## Entities Function App

There are 3 skills within the Entities function.  

- Concatenate (currently not used)
- Deduplication
- KeyPhrasesCleansing

During document processing, limitations on the number of characters certain Cognitive Services accept, textual content is therefore split into pages. 

Each page is then processed separately causing Named Entities Recognition or Key Phrases extraction to potential output the same entities across multiple pages. 

### Concatenate

Currently not used. 

### Deduplication

This skill is responsible to deduplicate all extracted NER across pages.

### KeyPhrases Cleansing 

Key Phrases produces a lot of noise (unsupervised effect) wich may collide with NER : some key phrases entries could be seen in locations already. 

This skill removes collision between KP and NER

                }
            ],
            "httpHeaders": {}
        },
```

**Note** Acronyms is a placeHolder if you wish to create or look up Acronyms.

Examples

- Creation scenario: If you have a key phrase "Department of Justice" you could output an acronym DoJ.
- Look up : Find an acronym in key phrases, look it up in your acronyms referential and add its defintion to key phrases. 


## Geo Function App 

### GeoLocations Skill

A very simple Geo location function/skill, to assign countries, capitals, cities and other locations. Such skill supports the Maps vertical experience.

Why? 

Named Entities Recognition will produce a set of locations with more or less granularity

(Supported Named Entity Recognition (NER) entity categories)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/named-entity-recognition/concepts/named-entity-categories#category-location]

The skill will take the produced NER locations, identify known capitals and countries and assign them to differents search fields. 

This is a very simple approach to enable geo-locations in your solution.

### Metadata Mapping 

This metadata mapping feature is allowing you to map any document metadata **source** to any search enrichment fields **target**. 

Important in order to simplify the mapping entries, the source entries are normalized : blank space and semi-column are replaced by dash. 

```C#
key.Replace(" ","-").Replace(":","-")
```

Examples
```
dcterms:modified => dcterms-modified 
```

The mapping is evaluated sequentially, so you can handle overwriting a target field. See the last_modified 

```json
[
  {
    "source": "dcterms-created",
    "target": [ "creation_date", "last_modified", "last_save_date" ]
  },
  {
    "source": "dcterms-modified",
    "target": [ "last_modified" ]
  },
  {
    "source": "meta-save-date",
    "target": [ "last_save_date" ]
  },
  {
    "source": "dc-subject",
    "target": [ "description" ]
  },
  {
    "source": "Category",
    "target": [ "user_categories" ],
    "transform": "SplitSemiColumn"
  },
  {
    "source": "meta-author",
    "target": [ "authors" ],
    "transform": "none"
  },
  {
    "source": "meta-last-author",
    "target": [ "authors" ],
    "transform": "none"
  },
  {
    "source": "meta-keyword",
    "target": [ "user_keywords" ],
    "transform": "SplitSemiColumn"
  },
  {
    "source": "custom-Tags",
    "target": [ "user_tags" ],
    "transform": "SplitSPTaxonomy"
  },
  {
    "source": "custom-Document-Type",
    "target": [ "user_tags" ],
    "transform": "SplitSPTaxonomy"
  }
]
```

**Note**: You may extend the metadata mapping to capture [EXIF tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) i.e. GPS latitude, lontitude or Altitude or [XMP tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform).

EXIF/XMP metadata are extracted by Apache Tika hence available for mapping !

### Content Security 

This is an important configuration to allow you to secure content based on location. The target are referencing Azure AD Groups (GUID). 

```json
[
  {
    "source": [ "folder1", "restricted" ],
    "target": [ "group1" ]
  },
  {
    "source": [ "folder2" , "restricted"],
    "target": [ "group2" ]
  },
  {
    "source": [ "folder3", "restricted" ],
    "target": [ "group3" ]
  }
]
```

In the above example, any content with folder1 and restricted part of their storage path will be secured with group1. Ans so on.

To assign a group, all source partial path have to match (AND). 

Groups are stored in the search index under the permissions field (list of AAD Guid).

### Content Group

```json
[
  {
    "source": [ "folder1"],
    "target": "Group1 Data"
  },
  {
    "source": [ "folder2"],
    "target": "Group2 Data"
  },
  {
    "source": [ "folder3"],
    "target": "Group3 Data"
  }
]
```

Content group follows the same framework as content security, it provides you an ability to logically group scattered data in a content_group facetable index field.

### TextMesh

This skill does a cleanup any input text like removing empty lines. It condenses the text to its minimun. 

This helps reducing the amount of non-textual characters, improve the translation side-by-side experience.

## Vision Function 

Probably the most important function as our solution has a strong visual information focus.

Please refer the function [README](../../src/CognitiveSearch.Skills/Python/Vision/README.md) for more details. 

## Need more Skills ? 

[Power Skills](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-power-skills) are a collection of useful functions to be deployed as custom skills for Azure Cognitive Search. The skills can be used as templates or starting points for your own custom skills, or they can be deployed and used as they are if they happen to meet your requirements.


## Efficiently scale out a custom skill

Custom skills are web APIs that implement a specific interface. A custom skill can be implemented on any publicly addressable resource. The most common implementations for custom skills are:

- Azure Functions for custom logic skills
- Azure Webapps for simple containerized AI skills
- Azure Kubernetes service for more complex or larger skills.

## Monitoring Azure Cognitive Search

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Cognitive Search and how to analyze and alert on this data with Azure Monitor.

# Basic Content Security Model

Protecting your data of unwanted exposure is crucial. As ACS doesn't include any data security model for indexing and querying, our solution accelerator provides one for your convenience. 

The proposed model provides a concept of public documents and private documents. 

## During Content Indexing 

The skill responsible to assign security permissions on your content is the Metadata Assign. 

2 index fields support our basic model. 

- **restricted**: boolean to indicate if a document is restricted to certain audience defined by permissions.
- **permissions**: list of Azure AD security groups ids representing the people authorized to search a document.

__index.json__ (snippet)
```json
    {
      "name": "restricted",
      "type": "Edm.Boolean",
      "facetable": false,
      "filterable": true,
      "key": false,
      "retrievable": true,
      "searchable": false,
      "sortable": false,
      "analyzer": null,
      "indexAnalyzer": null,
      "searchAnalyzer": null,
      "synonymMaps": [],
      "fields": []
    },
    {
      "name": "permissions",
      "type": "Collection(Edm.String)",
      "searchable": false,
      "filterable": true,
      "retrievable": false,
      "sortable": false,
      "facetable": false,
      "key": false,
      "indexAnalyzer": null,
      "searchAnalyzer": null,
      "analyzer": null,
      "synonymMaps": []
    }
```

## During Content Querying 

3 general parameters helps you control your content security implementation

__webappui.json__ 
```json
  {
    "name": "SearchServiceConfig:IsSecurityTrimmingEnabled",
    "value": true,
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "SearchServiceConfig:PermissionsPublicFilter",
    "value": "restricted eq false",
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "SearchServiceConfig:PermissionsProtectedFilter",
    "value": "restricted eq true",
    "slotSetting": false
  }
```

|Content Security Setting|Description|
|--|--|
|IsSecurityTrimmingEnabled|Flag to add security filters to each query|
|PermissionsPublicFilter|ACS filter ODATA syntax describing how to retrieve non secured documents|
|PermissionsProtectedFilter|ACS filter ODATA syntax describing how to retrieve secured documents|

**Capturing the user groups memberships** is possible when your UI is authenticated with an Azure AD Enterprise Application (EA). Upon authenticating an end-user, the security token will contain the list of groups memberships for the user. 

Refer to the Authentication.md located in your config folder for more details on how to setup Azure AD EA Authentication.

Our UI will go through those claims and generate the security filter accordingly. 

__AbstractApiController.cs__ 
```C#
    protected SearchPermission[] GetUserPermissions()
    {
        List<SearchPermission> permissions = new();

        permissions.Add(new SearchPermission() { group = GetUserId() });

        if (User.Claims.Any(c => c.Type == "groups"))
        {
            foreach (var item in User.Claims.Where(c => c.Type == "groups"))
            {
                permissions.Add(new SearchPermission() { group = item.Value });
            }
        }

        return permissions.ToArray();
    }
```

__Example of query filter added for security__

```odata
(restricted eq false) or ((restricted eq true) and (permissions/any(t: search.in(t, 'group1,group2,group3', ','))))
```
