__Knowledge Mining solution accelerator__

This repository contains all the code for deploying an end-to-end Knowledge Mining solution based on Azure Cognitive Search.

It is built on top of standards Azure services like Functions, Web App Services, Congitive Services & Cognitive Search. It provides a deployment pipeline allowing quick and easy setup of CI/CD pipelines for your projects.

For detailed documentation please refer to the __docs__ section of the repo containing the solution wiki.

# Before you start 

In order to successfully setup your solution you will need to have access to and or provisioned the following:

- Access to an Azure subscription (required)
- Access to an Azure DevOps subscription (optional)

An Owner or Contributor role is assumed on the Azure subscription or the targeted Resource Group. 

# Getting Started

Please refer to the [README](deployment/README.md) to deploy this solution accelerator. 

The directions provided in all guides assume you have a fundamental working knowledge of the Azure portal, Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Search, Functions, Storage and Azure Cognitives Services. 

For additional training and support, please see:

* [Knowledge Mining Bootcamp](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/LearnAI-KnowledgeMiningBootcamp)
* [AI in Cognitive Search documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-resources-documentation)

# Knowledge Mining overview

Knowledge mining (KM) is an emerging discipline in artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of intelligent services to quickly learn from vast amounts of information. It allows organizations to deeply understand and easily explore information, uncover hidden insights, and find relationships and patterns at scale.

[Knowledge Mining in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/knowledge-mining)

# What is this solution accelerator ? 

This KM solution accelerator aims to provide you with a workable end-to-end Knowledge Mining solution composed of : 
- Ingestion
    - Data ingestion from Azure Data Lake
- Enrichment
    - Data enrichment with Azure Applied AI and Cognitive Services
- Exploration
    - Keyword and Semantic search
    - Support for multiples search indexes
    - Content security model (permissions)
    - Modular User Interface 

With this cloud-based accelerator you will get an end-to-end solution with the tools to deploy, extend, operate & monitor.

In that respect, the solution provides 
- Azure Web App Authentication support 
- High configurability (json)
- Full Extensibility 
- Operations (PowerShell-based)
- Azure Pipelines for CI/CD 
- Deployment framework (manual or through CI/CD)

# Why a knowledge mining solution accelerator? 

This Knowledge Mining solution accelerator is inspired from another accelerator [Knowledge Mining Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-knowledge-mining). 

Based on our fields experience, we built features/skills to address common unstructured data challenges focusing on the usability and data explore experience. 

Below is a non-exhaustive list of key highlights:

* **Embedded images indexation** 
    - Images embedded in documents are indexed as documents not just for keywords search recall.
    - PDF pages are extracted as images (configurable).
    - A custom version of Apache Tika is used for images extraction.
    - Overcome the limit of [1000 normalized images](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-image-scenarios#get-normalized-images)

* **Image normalization** : 
    - handling oversized images for OCR completeness
    - support for TIFF format
    - thumbnails creation for UI support

* **Metadata**
    - Using Apache Tika we give you access to all metadata present in each document or image. A common scenario are Images with geo-location metadata i.e. EXIF GPS coordinates. 

* **HTML Conversion**
    - Having an HTML representation of a document could ease some NLP work. 
    - Table of contents is a common structure which we expose in the HTML representation of a PDF. 

* **Tables extraction**: tabular information are common in unstructured data corpus. The solution will extract, index and project tables to a dedicated knowledge store (optional).   

* **Translation**": there are two translation features in this solution
    * **Text Translation** : non-native content and title are normalized to a define language (default is english)
    * **Document Translation** : for non-native documents, the solution will translate them. They will follow the same Document processing as any document. Translated documents will provide you with translated tables for instance.

* **Text Analytics** : extract Entities (Named, Linked) from any document and OCR'ed image text.

* **Export to Excel**: popular ask when exploring unstructured data. 

* **Configurable UI**: building a UI is time consuming, we wanted to bring great UI configurability so you could bring to life new KM solutions in a timely manner.

# What Knowledge Mining scenarios this accelerator targets ?

This solution accelerator spirit is of a [Content Research](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/solution-ideas/articles/content-research) KM scenario. 

![](docs/architecture/knowledge-mining-content-research.png)

Nevertheless, since its architecture is open, you could use it as a foundation for more specialized KM scenarios.

**This solution accelerator is not targeted to any domain although its extensibility would give you the tools to make it domain specific.**

Some inspirational use-cases 
- AI-driven Data & Web Exploration
- Unstructured data Insights extraction (mine the unseen value)
- AI-Driven Strategy planning tool
- Intranet Semantic Search
- R&D portal for data discovery, patterns extraction & patents exploration
- etc.

You may think of productization such accelerator for your organization.

# Who is the target audience ?
