According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), renewable \nenergy employment alone (excluding efficiency) grew by nearly 18 percent between Q2 2015 and Q1 2016.1 The \nagency reports that 3,384,834 Americans were directly employed by the clean energy industry (which includes \nthe energy efficiency, smart grid, and energy storage industries; electric power generation from renewables; \nrenewable fuels production; and the electric, hybrid, and hydrogen-based vehicle industries) in Q1 2016. Among \nthe leading U.S. employment sectors were energy-efficient appliances, buildings, solar, wind, and bioenergy.2 The \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated there were 8,079,000 direct and indirect jobs in \nrenewable energy worldwide, with China, Brazil, the United States, and India among the leaders.3 \n \nBy comparison, DOE estimated that 2,989,844 Americans were directly employed by the fossil fuel industry \n(which includes fuels and electric power generation from coal, natural gas, and petroleum; and the \nmanufacturing of gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles and their component parts) in Q1 2016. More \nspecifically, natural gas and advanced gas technologies provided 398,235 jobs, coal provided 160,119, and \npetroleum provided 515,518, while gas and diesel vehicles supported 1,915,972 jobs.4 \n \nThis fact sheet focuses on employment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors in the United \nStates and around the world. The job figures cited below are sourced from DOE, as well as international \norganizations, national non-profits, think tanks, and national trade associations. Due to the lack of a single body \nwhich conducts job surveys, EESI has collected information from a number of sources which employ different \nresearch methodologies and different job definitions in their work. This reality makes it somewhat problematic \nto compare job estimates directly. Be advised that this represents a best effort to survey the status of \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency jobs with the data that is publicly available.  \n \n\nTRACKING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES \n \nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) defines green jobs as either \"jobs in businesses that produce goods \nand provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources\" or as \"jobs in which workers' \nduties involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer \nnatural resources.\"5 These definitions include employment in 1) renewable energy; 2) energy efficiency; 3) \npollution reduction and removal, greenhouse gas reduction, and recycling and reuse; 4) natural resources \nconservation; and 5) environmental compliance, education and training, and public awareness.6 \n \nIn Fiscal Year 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data for green jobs as a way of measuring \nprogress in green technology development. Unfortunately, in March of 2013, the Obama Administration was \ncompelled to order across-the-board spending cuts as part of the amended Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act, causing BLS to eliminate the Green Careers program, and thereby the collection of green \njobs statistics.7 The program has not yet been resumed.  \n\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\nIn January 2017, DOE published its second annual U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER). Using the BLS \nQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and BW Research Partnership's Energy Employment \nIndex (EEI), USEER presents employment data gathered from the U.S. fossil fuel, nuclear, and green energy \nindustries as of the end of the first quarter of 2016 (Q1 2016).8 More specifically, USEER compiles employment \nstatistics from four main sectors of the U.S. energy economy: \"Electric Power Generation and Fuels,\" \n\"Transmission, Distribution, and Storage,\" \"Energy Efficiency,\" and \"Motor Vehicles.\"9 All citations of USEER \nfindings in this fact sheet will be in reference to the Q1 2016 EEI employment statistics. \n \nThe following sections include employment assessments for the energy efficiency and renewable energy \nsectors from government agencies, nonprofits and industry groups. Many of the assessments include direct \nemployment (directly related to on-site operations), indirect employment (due to the supply of materials to \non-site operations), and induced employment (arising from spending by the direct and indirect workers). Data \ncollection methodology and specific job categorizations differ between assessments, because the information \nfor each sector was collected from different sources. \n \n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES \n \nUSEER found that the energy efficiency industry directly employed nearly 2,200,000 Americans in its green \nappliance and green building subsectors. USEER further states that the energy efficiency sector predicts a job \ngrowth rate of 9 to 11 percent for 2017.10 \n \nTable 1.

More specifically, the traditional HVAC industry (whose employees \noften have \"specific training in high efficiency HVAC systems\") provides 520,572 jobs, the Energy Star and high \nefficiency HVAC industry employs 552,147, and the efficient lighting industry employs 327,792.11 \n \nBuildings: Of the 6.5 million total construction jobs in the United States, about 21 percent of them conduct \nwork in support of the energy efficiency sector. The green buildings construction and/or materials sector \nprovides 446,796 energy efficiency jobs in the United States. More specifically, the renewable heating and \ncooling subsector employed 116,445 Americans.12 \n \nPublic Transportation: The American Public Transportation Association reported that the public transportation \nindustry grew by roughly 4.2 percent between 2013 and 2014, with the number of operations, maintenance, \nand administrative jobs increasing from 386,878 to 402,978 (a net job increase of 16,100 jobs). 13  More \nspecifically, the automotive transit sector (i.e., buses, trolleys, demand response, and transit vanpools) \nemployed 301,232 Americans, and the \"fixed-guideway\" transit sector (i.e., rail, streetcars, ferryboats, etc.) \nsupported 101,746 jobs.14 \n\nFor a deeper dive into \n\nenergy efficiency \n\nemployment trends by \n\nstate and locality, please \n\nrefer to Energy Efficiency \n\nJobs in America by \n\nEnvironmental \n\nEntrepreneurs (E2) and \n\nE4TheFuture (Dec. 2016). \n\nhttp://bit.ly/2017EEjobs \n\nhttp://bit.ly/2017EEjobs\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\n \nEnergy Storage: USEER reports that energy storage supported a total of 90,831 jobs in Q1 2016. Specifically, \npumped hydro provided 21,988 jobs, battery storage supported 47,634, while additional storage technologies \nhad 21,209.15 \n \nSmart Grid & Microgrid: According to USEER, the smart grid sector supported 19,745 jobs, while work on micro \ngrid development provided 14,890 jobs.16 USEER and E2 also reported that the energy storage sector provided \nan additional 27,140 jobs (which deal in \"clean [energy] distribution\") in Q2 2015.17, 18 In addition, E2 reports \nthat 70 \"smart grid/transmission\" jobs were announced in 2015.19 \n \nVehicles: USEER reported that the \"advanced vehicle\" industry provided 215,094 jobs in Q1 2016 spanning the \nmanufacturing of the vehicles and their component parts. The employment total accounts for hybrid-electric, \nplug-in hybrid, full-electric, hydrogen, and fuel cell vehicles in the United States.20 More specifically, USEER \nstates that the hybrid/plug-in hybrid sector employed 156,363 Americans, the electric vehicle sector employed \n41,991, and the hydrogen/fuel cell sector supported 16,740 jobs.21 \n \n \n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES \n \nAccording to USEER, the U.S. renewable energy industry provided 677,544 jobs in Q1 2016.22 The International \nRenewable Energy Agency (IRENA), meanwhile, recorded that renewable energy employment in the United \nStates reached 769,000 direct and indirect jobs in 2015 (not including large-scale hydropower employment), a \n6 percent increase from the previous year.23 The discrepancy is partly explained by IRENA’s inclusion of both \ndirect and indirect jobs, while DOE included only direct jobs in its calculations. For instance, IRENA's value of \n152,000 jobs for U.S. electricity generation from biomass only includes 15,500 direct jobs. IRENA also has \nsignificantly higher job estimates for the U.S. liquid biofuels and geothermal industries. \n \nThe reader is reminded that significant differences between reported job totals exist for some renewable \nenergy sectors, due to the inclusion of employment estimates from multiple government agencies and trade \norganizations. Each cited source features its own set of assumptions and methodologies for calculating job \ntotals, resulting in a range of employment estimates for wind, hydropower, geothermal, and other sectors. The \nvariety of estimates were included to provide a fuller understanding of how employment is currently \ninterpreted by industry analysts. \n \nTable 2.

The \nreport concluded that the solar industry provided a total of 260,077 jobs, distributed across all 50 states.25 Both \nUSEER and The Solar Foundation defined a solar job as one held by an individual who spends at least 50 percent \nof their time on solar-related work.26, 27 IRENA further reports that the solar photovoltaic subsector provided \n194,000 jobs, while the solar heating/cooling subsector and the concentrated solar power (CSP) subsector \nprovided roughly 10,000 and 4,000 jobs, respectively.28  \n \n  \n\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\nWind: USEER found that the wind power industry provided 101,738 jobs in Q1 2016.29 IRENA, meanwhile, \nreports that the American wind energy industry employed 88,000 Americans.30 The American Wind Energy \nAssociation (AWEA) corroborates IRENA’s 88,000 jobs estimate for the period, claiming that the wind power \nsector grew by roughly 20 percent between the end of 2014 and the end of 2015.31 More specifically, AWEA \nreports that the majority of the industry’s growth occurred in the \"wind project development and construction\" \nsubsector, which employed over 38,000 Americans. AWEA further reports that the manufacturing subsector \nprovided over 21,000 jobs, while the wind turbine servicing subsector employed over 8,800 technicians \n(identified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as the fastest growing job in the United States).32 33 \n \nHydropower: According to USEER, the American hydropower industry directly employed 65,554 Americans, \n56,259 of whom worked in the traditional hydropower sector and 9,295 in the low-impact hydroelectric \nsubsector.34 IRENA reported that the \"small hydropower\" industry directly provided approximately 8,000 jobs; \nit did not take into account U.S. \"large hydropower\" employment. 35 In a 2016 report specifically concerning \nthe U.S. hydroelectric industry, DOE concluded that, in 2013, the sector employed around 143,000 Americans, \nof which 118,000 worked in full-time operational and maintenance positions and 25,000 worked on short-term \nconstruction and upgrade projects.36 \n \nGeothermal: USEER reports that the geothermal power sector directly provided 5,768 jobs in Q1 2016.37 \nAlternatively, IRENA estimated that around 35,000 Americans worked in the geothermal industry, which (in \ncontrast to USEER’s definition) encompassed both the power and heating subsectors.38 In a 2016 report, the \nGeothermal Energy Association (GEA), Geothermal Exchange Organization (GEO), and Geothermal Resources \nCouncil (GRC) concluded that the incorporation of the full geothermal power potential of 9 Western states into \nthe electric grid would support approximately 121,140 direct, indirect, and induced jobs. The report estimated \nthat around 19,480 of these jobs would be full-time operational positions, and 101,300 would be temporary \nconstruction jobs lasting at least one year.39 \n \nWave & Ocean Power: In 2010, the Brookings-Battelle Clean Economy Database found 371 workers were \nsupported by the wave and ocean power industry.40 The Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition suggests marine \nand hydrokinetic energy could support 36,000 positions by 2030 in direct and indirect jobs in the United States, \nif its goal of installing 15 gigawatts of power is met.41     \n \nBiomass: According to USEER, the U.S. biomass power industry employs 7,980 Americans who work exclusively \nwith biomass electric generation technologies. 42  IRENA, however, reports that \"solid biomass\" energy \nproduction directly provides 15,000 jobs and supports an approximate total of 152,000 jobs in the United \nStates.43 \"Solid biomass\" excludes \"traditional biomass,\" which refers to wood, charcoal, agricultural residues \nor animal dung used for residential cooking and heating, particularly in developing countries. The Biomass \nPower Association corroborates IRENA’s direct jobs estimate, and finds that the more than 15,500 American \nbiomass energy employees working in 80 power-generating facilities across 20 states produce nearly 50 \npercent of America’s total renewable electricity.44, 45 \n \nWaste-to-Energy: A 2016 Energy Recovery Council report suggests that in 2013, 5,350 direct jobs were \nsupported in the waste-to-energy industry. This number includes workers who are employed on-site and off-\nsite by owners, operators, and local governments involved in the industry. Indirectly, the industry provides \nanother 8,600 jobs, for a total of about 14,000 jobs.46 A 2015 report published by the National Association of \nCounties calculates that an average waste-to-energy facility capable of processing 1,500 tons of waste per day \nprovides 248 direct jobs and 52 indirect jobs during construction and 59 permanent direct jobs for the plant's \noperation and maintenance.47  \n \n  \n\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\nBiogas: Although there is no data for total U.S. employment in biogas, E2 found that the American biogas \nenergy industry announced 193 new jobs in 2015.48 In 2016, the American Biogas Council reported that over \n2,100 biogas systems are currently in operation in the United States. In addition, the report suggested that \nmore than 11,000 additional dairy/swine farms, wastewater treatment plants, and landfill gas projects could \nbe effectively converted into biogas production facilities. The Council concluded that these new systems could \nsupport roughly 275,000 temporary construction jobs and 18,000 full-time operational positions.49 \n \nRenewable Fuels: According to USEER, the U.S. renewable fuels industry directly employed 104,663 \nAmericans.50 IRENA reports that, in 2015, the U.S. \"liquid biofuels\" sector provided roughly 277,000 jobs.51 \nAlternatively, the Fuels America coalition calculated that in 2014 there were 852,056 total renewable fuels jobs \nin the United States, 292,166 of which were direct jobs, 226,098 were induced, and 333,792 were in the supply \nchain. 52 The following is a job breakdown for the three main sectors of renewable fuels. \n \nEthanol: USEER found that the corn ethanol subsector provided 28,613 jobs.53 On the other hand, IRENA \nreports that the U.S. ethanol industry employed 227,562 Americans. 54  According to the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, the domestic ethanol sector supported 357,407 jobs at the end of 2015, 85,967 of which were \ndirect and 271,440 indirect/induced. 55  More specifically, Agricultural and Biofuels Consulting, LLP found \nroughly 10,400 employees working full-time directly in ethanol production facilities.56 \n \nBiodiesel: USEER includes American biodiesel jobs with the non-corn ethanol and non-woody biomass sectors, \ntotaling 23,088 jobs in Q1 2016. According to IRENA, the U.S. biodiesel sector employed 49,486 Americans at \nthe end of 2015.57 The National Biodiesel Board found that the domestic biodiesel directly provided roughly \n31,000 jobs and supported a total of more than 62,200 jobs nationwide (as of March 2016). 58 , 59  LMC \nInternational concluded that the biodiesel industry in the United States employed a total of roughly 47,400 \njobs (46,500 in domestic production operations, and 900 in projects relating to imported biodiesel60). \n \nAdvanced Biofuels: USEER found that biofuels production derived from woody biomass and cellulosic \nfeedstocks supported 30,458 direct jobs in Q1 2016. Additionally, USEER reported that renewable fuel projects \ninvolving woody biomass employed 18,031 Americans. In 2013, E2 found that advanced biofuel companies \nreported they were supporting about 4,500 direct, full-time jobs.61 \n \n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS AROUND THE WORLD \n \n\nThe following data is from the International Renewable Energy Agency. All of the reported data is as of the end \nof 2015, except for that of the European Union, which dates to the end of 2014.  \n \nIn its 2016 Renewable Energy and Jobs Annual Report, IRENA estimated that there were approximately \n8,079,000 direct and indirect jobs in the renewable energy sector across the world. The nine primary sectors \nof renewable energy covered by the report were biomass, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, small \nhydropower, solar photovoltaic (PV), CSP, solar heating/cooling, and wind power. The report reveals that \nChina leads global employment in renewable energy with roughly 3,523,000 direct and indirect jobs, \nfollowed by Brazil, the United States, India, Japan, Germany, and France.62   \n \nAcross the globe, the solar PV subsector had the highest employment in the renewable energy sector, with \naround 2,772,000 jobs. Liquid biofuels and wind power followed closely behind, employing around 1,678,000 \nand 1,081,000 individuals (respectively). While IRENA did not present large hydropower employment on a \ncountry-by-country basis, the report states that the industry supported more than 1,300,000 direct jobs \nworldwide at the end of 2015. The report’s total renewable energy employment estimate includes \napproximately 3,700 ocean energy subsector jobs and 11,000 renewable municipal and industrial waste-to-\nenergy subsector jobs.63 \n\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\n \nThe following is a breakdown of green jobs in the countries with the largest amount of renewable energy \nemployment. \n \nTable 3.

China leads the world \nin solar PV subsector employment, with the industry providing around 1,652,000 direct and indirect jobs. China \nalso leads the world in large hydropower energy employment, providing more than 442,000 jobs (or roughly \n34 percent of the subsector’s total global employment). Following solar PV and large hydropower, China’s other \nlarge renewable energy employment sectors include solid biomass with 822,000 job, solar heating/cooling with \n743,000 jobs, wind power with 507,000 jobs, and biogas with 209,000 jobs.64 \n \nBrazil: According to IRENA, Brazil has the second greatest number of renewable energy jobs worldwide, with a \ntotal of 918,000 jobs. Brazil tops the charts globally in terms of liquid biofuel industry employment, with a total \nof around 821,000 jobs. The liquid biofuel subsector not only directly provides 268,400 sugarcane production, \n190,000 ethanol processing and 162,600 biodiesel jobs, but it also indirectly supports 200,000 equipment \nmanufacturing positions. Additionally, the report identifies Brazil as the second largest large-scale hydropower \nemployer, providing approximately 195,000 direct jobs (or roughly 15 percent of the subsector’s total global \nemployment). IRENA further notes that the nation offers 41,000 jobs in solar heating/cooling equipment \nmanufacturing and installation, 41,000 jobs in wind power, and 12,000 jobs in small hydropower.65 \n \nIndia: India has the fourth largest number of renewable energy jobs globally, employing 416,000 people \ndirectly and indirectly in the sector. IRENA identified India’s largest renewable energy subsector to be large-\nscale hydropower, directly employing 104,000 individuals. India’s solar PV subsector was its second largest \nrenewable energy employer, supporting roughly 103,000 direct and indirect jobs. 66  India’s other large \nrenewable energy employers include the biogas industry (85,000 jobs), the solar heating/cooling industry \n(75,000 jobs), the solid biomass industry (58,000 jobs), the wind power industry (48,000 jobs), the liquid \nbiofuels industry (35,000 jobs), and the small hydropower industry (12,000 jobs).67 \n \nJapan: IRENA reports that Japan is the world’s fifth largest renewable energy employer, supporting roughly \n388,000 direct and indirect jobs. In addition, the report found that Japan trails only China in terms of total solar \nPV employment, with the subsector supporting around 377,000 direct and indirect jobs. Japan also provides \naround 5,000 wind power, 3,000 liquid biofuel, and 2,000 geothermal jobs.68 \n \n  \n\n\n\nEESI        1112 16th Street, NW, Suite 300       Washington, DC 20036        (202) 628-1400        www.eesi.org \n \n\n \nGermany: In addition to being the sixth largest renewable energy employer in the world, Germany has the \nmost renewable energy jobs of any single country in the European Union, for a total of 355,000 jobs. Germany \nleads the European Union in wind power employment, supporting around 149,000 jobs. Germany’s other \nnotable subsector-specific employment includes 49,000 jobs in solid biomass, 48,000 jobs in biogas, 38,000 \njobs in solar PV, 23,000 jobs in liquid biofuels, and 700 jobs in Concentrated Solar Power. Additionally, Germany \nemployed 8,300 individuals in publicly-funded renewable energy R&D and administration projects.69 \n \nFrance: IRENA found that France provided the seventh largest number of renewable energy jobs at the end of \n2015, supporting around 170,000 direct and indirect jobs. The nation’s two largest renewable energy \nsubsectors were the solid biomass and liquid biofuels industries, which provided approximately 48,000 and \n35,000 jobs, respectively. Furthermore, France trailed only the United States in geothermal energy \nemployment, with a total of approximately 31,000 jobs.70 \n \nBangladesh: According to IRENA, Bangladesh was the eighth largest renewable energy employer, supporting \naround 141,000 direct and indirect jobs. The nation provided the fourth largest number of solar PV jobs \nworldwide, with a total of approximately 127,000. Following solar PV, the report identified Bangladesh’s largest \nrenewable energy subsectors as biogas (9,000 jobs) and small hydropower (5,000 jobs).71 \n \nRest of the European Union (EU): Excluding Germany and France, the European Union provided around \n644,000 total renewable energy jobs (76,300 of which were in Spain). The European Union led the world in \ngeothermal and CSP energy employment, supporting approximately 55,000 and 5,000 jobs, respectively. The \nEuropean Union also provided the second largest number of solid biomass and small hydropower jobs globally, \nwith a total of around 214,000 and 31,000 jobs, respectively. The report further concluded that the European \nUnion provided around 84,000 solar PV jobs. Within the Union, the United Kingdom trailed only Germany in \nsolar PV employment, with a total of 35,000 jobs. Lastly, IRENA provided employment data for the ocean energy \nand renewable municipal and industrial waste-to-energy subsectors, which provided 3,700 and 8,000 jobs, \nrespectively.72 \n \nThe European Union is also known for its widespread use of wind power, a sector which employed 162,000 \nindividuals (30,000 of which worked in Denmark alone). IRENA also found that the European Union – specifically \nGermany, the United Kingdom, and Denmark – led the world in offshore wind employment, with Denmark \nproviding 10,000 of these jobs. 73  \n \n \n\n \n \n\nAuthor: Daniel Lopez \nEditor: Brian La Shier \n\n \n \n\nThis fact sheet is available electronically (with hyperlinks and endnotes) at www.eesi.org/papers. \n \n \n\nThe Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 by a bipartisan \n\nCongressional caucus dedicated to finding innovative environmental and energy solutions.

This publication is an ambitious task, seeking to capture the \nkey renewable energy market highlights across the vast Asia-Pacific region, \nand provide a reference tool for the entrepreneurs, investors, inventors, \neconomists, developers, financiers and regulators of 21st century renewable \nenergy issues. \n\nFor this Edition 4, we provide a high-level analysis in a standardised template \nof 21 Asia-Pacific jurisdictions, including: \n\n■■ the two burgeoning economies of our time, which increasingly shape not \nonly energy politics, but global politics: the People’s Republic of China \nand India;\n\n■■ the developed markets of the south (Australia and New Zealand) and \nthe north (Japan and the Republic of Korea);\n\n■■ the advanced ‘city states’ of Hong Kong SAR and Singapore; \n\n■■ the vast, developing economies in mainland Asia: Pakistan, Mongolia \nand Myanmar;\n\n■■ the growing coastal economies of South and Southeast Asia: Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, \nThailand and Vietnam; and\n\n■■ two key case studies from the South Pacific: Papua New Guinea and \nVanuatu.\n\nWe have also taken a sub-regional focus, particularly in large countries, \nwhere generalisations based on national boundaries can be crude when \nfailing to take into account local policies and regulatory conditions. \n\nWithin this Introduction is a brief analysis on climate change adaptation \nissues, particularly in light of the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. At the back \nof this publication is a feed-in tariff comparison table, offering a glimpse into \ngovernment investment levels as a key driver of renewables investment  \n(we have also provided some European rates and commentary for \nbenchmarking purposes). \n\nOur last edition\n\nIn DLA Piper’s most recent edition of this publication (Updated Edition 3, \npublished October 2014) we noted China’s leadership of the Asia-Pacific \nrenewables markets. We also looked at the emergence of a ‘two-track’ \nrenewables economy between governments committed to fund feed-in \ntariffs and investment incentives, and others more reticent to altering the \ntraditional energy mix and overcoming short term barriers to investment.\n\nThis gap remains, and China is still the clear front runner for renewables \ninvestment generally. However, another emerging pattern in the region is \nwhat might be termed an ‘adjustment period’. \n\nThe modern renewable \nenergy sector presents \na range of opportunities \nand possibilities in the \nAsia-Pacific region. \nEntrepreneurs are seeking \nto disrupt the traditional, \nvertically-integrated supply \nchain of a bygone era. \nInventors are looking for \nnew and more efficient \nmaterials and storage \ncapabilities. Developers \nare investing in mega-\nprojects to service \ngrowing middle classes. \nAnd environmentalists \nare promoting non-\nhydropowered, clean \nsources of energy for \ncarbon and pollution \nreduction. Governments \nare attempting to keep \ntrack of the sustained \nlevel of investment into \nthis dynamic sector, whilst \nalso maintaining security, \nstability and diversity in \nenergy supply for their \npopulations both on and \noff the grid.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 05\n\nMoving from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a \ngenerational change that will not be easily completed. \nRenewables have high start-up costs and require \ngovernments to prop-up the industry in the short term, \nwith the knowledge that cheap (or almost free) fuel from \nthe wind, sun and rivers, will reduce electricity prices in the \nlonger term. While renewables investments continue on a \nlarge scale across the region, there is a realisation that any \ngains in the overall percentage contribution of renewable \nenergy to national electricity generation will be hard-won, \nparticularly as electricity demand continues to rise in \npopulous jurisdictions. \n\nSome countries have reduced the scope, period or rates \nfor subsidies (like feed-in tariffs), either because all capacity \nhas been filled or the government is no longer willing to \ninterfere in the renewables market, citing cost concerns \n(auctions have become more common as a way of the \nmarket determining prices, rather than government-\nimposed rates). While renewables investment remains \nhealthy across the region, so does investment in fossil fuels \nwith large coal mines and plants continuing to be built, \nlargely out of concern for security of electricity supply and \nthe-always-sensitive issue of short term electricity prices. \n\nSome highlights across Asia-Pacific\n\nIndia is fast emerging as a renewables powerhouse, \nparticularly in terms of solar photovoltaic. Under the \nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy, India has seen a \nreal growth in large-scale solar farms. In 2007, the country \nwas producing 10GW in renewable energy, today it is more \nthan 42GW. While the country might fall short of its (very) \nambitious 2022 solar target of 100GW, investments in non-\nhydropower sources of energy have seen consistent growth.\n\nChina remains a clear powerhouse of the renewables \nworld, however there has been an unmistakable glut in \nthe market resulting from excess wind turbines and solar \npanels. Renewables plants have become ‘stranded’ and lay \n‘idle’ due to insufficient transmission infrastructure, leading \nto a period of consolidation for the sector. China is also \nexpected to launch its National Carbon Scheme in the \nsecond half of 2017, which will be a key pilot for carbon \npricing schemes around the world.\n\nThailand and the Philippines are perhaps the leading \nmarkets in Southeast Asia. About US$2 billion was invested \nin the Thai solar market in 2015 alone with investors clearly \nunperturbed by the change in government in Bangkok. \nThe Philippines, which experienced a boom in renewable \nenergy projects under the previous Aquino administration \n\nis perhaps the best regulated market in the region and has \nhad healthy investment levels towards its 35% renewables \ncontribution by 2030. Despite this, large coal mines \ncontinue to be built with dozens more in the pipeline. \nLike the Philippines, Sri Lanka too has historically high \nlevels of hydropower penetration in the electricity sector. \nIt is seeking to rely on hydropower to reach its ambitious \n2020 target of 60% renewables contribution. \n\nJapan was thrust into the global energy spotlight for several \nyears following a severe earthquake in 2011 and subsequent \nexplosions at nuclear reactors in Fukushima. Nuclear power \nplants remain largely offline and attempts to re-open some \nhave been met by community-led lawsuits. Continued \nliberalisation of the electricity sector has been combined \nwith steady growth in wind and solar as the country seeks \n22 to 24% renewables contribution by 2030 (the nuclear \ntarget is 20 to 22%). Vietnam too, is seeking to liberalise \nits electricity supply chain. It remains in the formative stages \nof developing its renewables industry, however the country \ndoes have some large-scale hydropower facilities and \nrecently announced its long-awaited solar feed-in tariff. \n\nAs part of Malaysia’s 2016 – 2020 plan, the Government \nhas emphasised the need for diversification. Large-scale \nsolar has seen some success in 2016, however solar feed-in \ntariffs are largely closed after a strong period of investment. \n\nForeign investor concerns remain in Myanmar, which is \nstill designing a regulatory framework for its energy sector \nand may yet be lured by the abundant known fossil fuel \nand mineral reserves in its north. Pakistan too suffers \nfrom foreign investor concerns, however in partnership \nwith Beijing, it is seeking to add 10,400MW of electricity \nsupply, including from large hydropower dams, to address \nits current “energy crisis”. Mongolia has seen a shift \nback towards fossil fuels, although the Government is \ncoordinating research into utilising the Gobi Desert as a \nrenewable energy generating hub. Myanmar, Pakistan and \nMongolia are each well-positioned to benefit from Beijing’s \n‘one-belt one-road’ initiative over the coming decade.\n\n\n\n06 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nIndonesia’s renewable energy market has not seen \nany notable developments at a national level in recent \ntimes, while the small ‘city states’ of Hong Kong SAR \nand Singapore have no pretences about their plans \nto continue to rely on importing natural gas to meet \ndomestic energy needs, focusing instead on energy \nefficient building measures. \n\nThe low-lying Maldives has seemingly retracted its \ncarbon neutral pledge, but still sees a role for large-scale \nsolar photovoltaic in its archipelago.\n\nPapua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Timor-Leste \nprovide interesting case studies for how small nations are \nseeking to replace imported diesel with more sustainable \noptions such as solar (in Timor-Leste), hydropower \n(in Papua New Guinea) and geothermal (in Vanuatu). \nSmaller-scale systems have been touted as the answer \nto low electrification rates, particularly as archipelagic \nor mountainous geography challenges transmission \ninfrastructure and a lack of regulatory frameworks \nhinders nationwide coordination.\n\nThe Republic of Korea’s renewables investments have \nbeen concentrated on two large offshore projects: a \nlarge offshore wind farm and tidal station, both near Jeju \nIsland. \n\nBipartisan agreement on Australia’s renewable energy \ntarget (33,000GWh by 2020) was a result of almost \na decade of protracted political debate. Despite the \ncurrent conservative government’s commitment to \nlarge-scale coal mines, wind farms (particularly in \nSouth Australia) and solar photovoltaic plants continue \nto come online. A looming energy ‘crisis’ as old baseload \npower plants are taken offline may lead to a renewed \nfocus on hydropower (including expanding the historic \nSnowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme) and  \nlarge-scale solar.\n\nFinally, New Zealand remains a regional leader in the \nrenewables space. It has avoided the politicisation of \nits energy mix (unlike its larger neighbour, Australia). \nHydropower is New Zealand’s major source of power \ngeneration, and nearly 20% of the country’s electricity \nsupply comes from geothermal sources. Increasingly \nNew Zealand is exporting its geothermal know-\nhow to countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \nNew Zealand’s 2025 renewables target of 90% is far \nbeyond the ‘usual’ targets in the region, of around 20 to \n30% by 2020/2030. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 07\n\nAs always, we welcome any feedback on this publication. \n\nStephen Webb\nPartner and Head of Energy, \nAsia Pacific\nT +61 7 3246 4208\nstephen.webb@dlapiper.com\n\nConclusion\n\nClimate change is certainly a long-term driver of \nrenewable energy investment, however the more \nimmediate concern in the region is diversity and security \nin supply, and unease over electricity prices. While \nrenewables costs continue to fall drastically, sustained \ninvestment levels in coal and natural gas across the Asia-\nPacific suggest that varied energy mixes will likely be the \nnorm across the region for years to come. \n\nPost-Paris climate\n\nAfter 20 years of slow international progress towards \naddressing climate change, the Paris Agreement was \nsigned on 12 December 2015, and entered into force \non 4 November 2016. The Paris Agreement represents \nuniversal international consensus on the manner in which \nclimate change will be addressed. It also represents an \nencouraging sign for the development of renewable \nenergy in the Asia-Pacific region, although Asia-Pacific \ncountries are still likely to retain a diverse energy profile \nin the coming decades.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, 196 countries have agreed to:\n\n■■ hold increases in the global average temperature to \nwell below 2°C above pre–industrial levels, and strive \nto limit the increase to 1.5°C; and\n\n■■ reach peak emissions as soon as possible and then \nrapidly reduce emissions levels, with the aim of \nessentially achieving net-zero emissions (expressed as \na “balance” of anthropogenic emissions and removals) \nin the second half of this century.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, with its unprecedented scope, \nrepresents a high point in global action to combat \nclimate change. In contrast to the Kyoto Protocol, which \nimposed emissions targets on countries in a ‘top down’ \napproach, parties to the Paris Agreement set their own \nemission reductions targets (Nationally Determined \nContributions, NDCs). This allows countries to take \naction appropriate to their domestic circumstances. \nFrom 2020, countries will be expected to increase \ntheir NDCs every five years in order to achieve these \nlong-term goals. The Agreement also establishes a \ntransparency framework through which states are held \naccountable for their progress.\n\nPutting to one side the uncertainty over the \nUnited States’ future role within the Paris Agreement \nframework, successful implementation of the Agreement \nwill face headwinds. The voluntary carbon reduction \ntargets currently pledged in States’ NDCs are \ninadequate to achieve the ambitious goal to keep global \ntemperatures ‘well below 2°C’. Further, enforcement of \nNDCs will be difficult in the event a State fails to meet \nits commitments. Many developing countries have made \ntheir NDCs ‘contingent on finance’, which will require \nsubstantial financial contributions from developed \ncountries.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, each country faces their own \nunique challenges. Vast and challenging geographies, \nsocial and political uncertainty and ongoing energy \nsecurity concerns will all play a role. Financing the \nhuge scale of necessary mitigation and adaptation \nmeasures will continue to be a challenge and successful \nimplementation will depend on innovative approaches \nto financing renewable energy projects. Growth in the \nrenewables sector is essential for meeting the ambitious \nglobal imperative for carbon mitigation in the Paris \nAgreement. While States’ NDC pledges vary in scope \nand content, many include carbon reduction targets \nwith specific ambitions to increase the national share \nof renewable energy or proposed policy measures to \nthat effect. There has been growing momentum since \nthe Paris Agreement, with renewable investment hitting \nnew records – by March 2016, investment in renewable \nenergy had doubled that of coal and gas. A surge in global \ninvestments in renewables to around US$500 billion \nannually from 2020 will be critical for meeting the goals \nof the Paris Agreement and securing a safe climate future. \n\nDLA Piper was honoured to be involved in the Paris \nAgreement negotiations, assisting various countries on a \npro bono basis. \n\n\n\n08 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Common Law\n\nLanguage: English\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report 2017: 15 of 190 (down 2 rankings) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 22 of 138 (down 1 ranking)\n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 5 of 180 (no change)\n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 13 of 176 (no change) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 2 of 188 (no change)\n\nPopulation: 23.1 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$60,070\n\nPROFILE\n\nAustralia was inhabited by Indigenous persons for thousands of years before the British established a colony in \nNew South Wales in 1788. Australia’s six States formed a federation in 1901. The governance model was (and \nremains) largely a fusion of US federalism and a UK system of governance. Since World War Two, Australia \nhas been an ally of the United States but now finds its economic security in Asia. Countries like China, Japan \nand India have fuelled Australia’s resources boom, which saw it largely avoid the global financial crisis. While \nconcerns have been raised about growing national debt, Australia’s economy is one of the most developed in \nthe world. Australia is a multicultural society with one in four citizens born overseas. \n\nAUSTRALIA\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 09\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels for domestic \nconsumption and for export. \n\n■■ Australia is currently the world’s largest coal exporter, \naccounting for approximately one-third of all coal \nexported globally. Australia has huge onshore and \noffshore gas reserves, primarily within the ‘mining \nStates’ of Queensland and Western Australia. \nEnergy exports earned the economy approximately \nAU$67 billion (approx. US$51.3 billion) in 2014/15. \nThe size of Australia’s energy exports rose to \nprominence in March 2017 when it emerged that \nAustralia may face a domestic gas supply shortage \nin 2018 unless protective steps are taken to ensure \ndomestic supply.\n\n■■ The Australian Government has recently backed a \nAU$100 billion (approx. US$76.6 billion) investment \ntarget to expand the coal industry. \n\n■■ Growing demand for fossil fuels from Asia has resulted \nin the opening up of new mines in the Galilee Basin \nand Bowen Basins in central Queensland (although \nthese mines have been subject to lengthy State and \nFederal approvals processes and concerns about the \nimpact on the Great Barrier Reef have been raised \nfrom environmental groups). \n\n■■ An independent review into the reliability and stability \nof the National Electricity Market, known as the \nFinkel review, was released in March 2017. The Finkel \nreview sought submissions regarding coordinated, \nnational reform that is needed to maintain the \nsecurity, affordability, reliability and sustainability of \nthe electricity market. Depending on how many of \nthe reforms are adopted, the review could have far-\nreaching effects on how the national electricity market \noperates. \n\nRegulators\n\nSubject to any changes that may be implemented \nfollowing the Finkel review, there are three main energy \nmarket regulators in Australia:\n\n■■ The Australian Energy Market Operator which \n“operates the energy markets and systems and also \ndelivers planning advice in eastern and south-eastern \nAustralia”;\n\n■■ The Australian Energy Market Commission, which \ndescribes itself as the “rule maker and developer for \nAustralian energy markets”, notably for the National \nElectricity Market; and\n\n■■ The Australian Energy Regulator, which operates \nunder the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). \nThe regulator’s work relates mostly to energy \nmarkets in eastern and south eastern Australia on \nissues like price setting, market monitoring, publishing \ninformation on energy markets and assisting the \nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission \nwith energy-related issues.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The National Electricity and Gas Rules established \nthe National Energy Market, which is managed by the \nAustralian Energy Market Operator.\n\n■■ Together, the National Electricity Rules and \nthe National Electricity Code govern access to \ntransmission and distribution networks and set out \nthe market rules including market operations, power \nsystem security, network connection, access and \npricing for services in the National Energy Market.\n\n■■ These rules have the force of law and are made under \nthe National Electricity Law.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ On the east coast of Australia there is retail \ncompetition through the National Energy Market. \nThe market is connected by six major transmission \ninterconnectors, which link the electricity networks \nof New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, \nTasmania and Victoria. The network consists of \nnearly one million kilometres of underground and \noverhead transmission and distribution lines/cables.\n\n■■ Because of their geographical isolation, the Northern \nTerritory and Western Australia have their own \nelectricity markets.\n\n■■ There is a mix of State government ownership and \nprivate ownership of electricity infrastructure. \nPrivatisation of electricity assets owned by State \ngovernments has become politicised, receiving \nstrong opposition from opponents of privatisation \nincluding unions. \n\n\n\n10 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nEnergy White Paper 2015\n\n■■ In April 2015, the Energy White Paper was released \nby the Liberal-led Federal Government. The paper \nset out the short and long-term strategic policy \nframework to address the challenges in Australia’s \nenergy sector. \n\n■■ The paper has been criticised for being too generic \nand lacking a clear strategy, with only broad \nstatements about increasing competition and removing \nregulatory barriers and taxes. The paper was also \ncriticised for containing only one reference to climate \nchange. \n\n■■ Recommendations from the paper included the \nprivatisation of remaining state-owned electricity \nassets and the rejection of a proposal for a domestic \ngas reserve, despite rising gas prices. Selling electricity \nassets is a decision made by State governments.\n\n■■ The report says electricity from fossil fuels, \nparticularly coal, will continue to play a “vital role” \nin “providing low-cost energy around the world” \nand that investment support for low emissions \ntechnology, such as carbon capture and storage, \nwill be important for Australia. In 2017, the Australian \nGovernment launched initiatives such as the National \nLow Emissions Coal Initiative and the Carbon Capture \nand Storage Research Development & Demonstration \nFund to encourage industry to reduce emissions by \nadopting these technologies. \n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ According to the Clean Energy Council, in 2015, \n14.6% of Australia’s electricity generation was from \nrenewable energy. This represented an increase \nfrom 12.5% in 2014. One of the more interesting \nstatistics from the report was the variance in \n‘renewables penetration’ in each State. Tasmania \nhad 99.9% penetration (largely from hydropower) \nand South Australia had 41.3% (largely from wind \npower), however the remaining more populous States \nlike Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales \nand Queensland ranged between 12.1% and 4.4% \npenetration. \n\n■■ Renewable energy and attempts to address climate \nchange have been the ‘poisoned chalice’ of Australian \npolitics for almost a decade. This has resulted in \na prolonged period of uncertainty for renewables \ninvestment in the country. \n\n■■ Despite this, there were positive signs in 2016 with \nAustralian renewables investment growing by 49%, up \nfrom two weak years of renewables investment. The \ntotal clean energy investment reached AU$4.29 billion \n(approx. US$3.3 billion) however this is still below \nthe AU$5 billion (approx. US$3.8 billion) plus \nmilestone reached between 2010 and 2013. The Clean \nEnergy Council estimates AU$1.2 billion (approx. \nUS$918.4 million) was funnelled into major projects, \nwith most of these ventures receiving support from \nthe Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) \nor other state-based renewable energy programs. \n\n■■ The key Federal Government policy in respect of \nrenewable energy is the Renewable Energy Target \n(RET). The RET mandates that about 20% of \nAustralia’s electricity generation in 2020 will be from \nrenewable sources. The RET is divided into small-scale \nand large-scale generation certificates. \n\n■■ Bipartisan support of the RET target of \n33,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2020 \nhas led to considerably more investment and activity \nin the renewables sector.\n\n■■ The Emissions Reduction Fund was established by \nthe previous conservative government under Prime \nMinister Tony Abbott and replaced the carbon pricing \nmechanism. The fund provides incentives for reduction \nactivities across the Australian economy. The objective \nof the fund is to achieve Australia’s 2020 emissions \nreduction target of 5% below 2000 levels by 2020. \nThe Government has so far provided AU$2.55 billion \n(approx. US$1.95 billion) to establish the fund. \n\n■■ Australia has a complex regulatory regime for \nrenewable energy, with a range of Federal and State \nGovernment laws and policy mechanisms that apply. \nThe Council of Australian Governments Energy \nCouncil, the decision-making body of federal and state \nenergy and resources ministers, formally recognised \nthe critical connection between energy and climate \npolicy in July 2015. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 11\n\n■■ The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the \nrenewables industry employs 14,020 people in \nAustralia, compared with about 55,000 direct jobs in \nthe coal industry. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower currently accounts for 40.1% of \nthe renewable electricity produced in Australia. \nThe majority of this energy is generated by Tasmania’s \nhydropower plants and the Snowy Mountains \nHydro-Electric Scheme in New South Wales. \n\n■■ Australia’s hydropower generation capacity is \ncurrently 7,800MW. This has decreased slightly due to \nlow rainfall. \n\n■■ Hydropower production is expected to reach \n18TWh by 2019-2020.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Wind generation increased by just over 20% in \n2015. Current generation capacity is over 2.58GW. \nSouth Australia accounts for about half of this \ninstalled capacity. \n\n■■ Five new wind farms were completed in 2015 and \nmore than 8,000MW of wind power projects are \neither under construction or have planning approval. \n\n■■ The land use planning regime applying to wind \nenergy varies greatly between States. In recent \nyears some State Governments have introduced \nnew planning regulations which restrict where \nnew wind farms may be built. A range of reasons \nhave been cited for these amendments including \nconcerns in some sectors of the community about \nthe mental and physical effects of low frequency \nnoise produced by wind turbines (‘wind turbine \nsyndrome’). For example, planning regulations in \nthe State of Victoria give residents who live within \n2km of a proposed wind turbine the power of veto \nover that project. These regulatory amendments \nhave created an additional barrier to wind farm \napprovals in many areas.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Solar energy generation has increased dramatically in \nAustralia over the last decade. \n\n■■ Solar energy generation increased by just over 20% \nin 2015 and eight solar farms were completed. At the \nend of 2015, Australia had 19 operation solar projects \nlarger than 1MW in size. \n\n■■ Another large project, the 56MW Moree Solar Farm \nby Spanish renewables giant FRV, was launched in \nearly 2016. \n\n■■ ARENA announced a AU$100 million (approx. \nUS$75.4 million) funding program for large-scale \nsolar projects which successfully facilitated project \nfinancing for a number of projects. Large-scale solar \nphotovoltaic electricity generation is now considered \ncommercially viable. \n\n■■ More than 2,500MW of solar power projects are \neither under construction or have planning approval. \n\n■■ Residential-based solar photovoltaic panels have been \na success story in Australia. A number of State-based \ninitiatives (led by the Australian Capital Territory) \nhave resulted in significant uptake of solar panels \non residential dwellings. It is estimated that over \none million households now have solar photovoltaic \npanels installed Australia-wide, capable of generating \napproximately 5GW of electricity. \n\n■■ Solar thermal energy in Australia is still in the early \nstages of development. In 2012, the Australian Solar \nThermal Research Initiative was founded. It is an \neight-year, AU$87.3 million (approx. US$65.9 million) \nresearch initiative designed to support the emerging \nconcentrated solar thermal industry in Australia. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Geothermal energy is an emerging industry in \nAustralia. Australia’s current geothermal production \nis very limited. There is only one operational facility in \nAustralia – an 80kW plant in Birdsville, Queensland. \n\n■■ Several large projects are currently in various stages of \ndevelopment and approval. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Australia produces about 20 million tonnes of organic \nwaste per year from domestic and industrial sources. \n\n■■ Biogas contributed 2.0% of the total renewable energy \ngeneration in 2013. Some proponents suggest that in \nthe future biogas could be more important than solar \nenergy and as important as wind energy. \n\n\n\n12 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ There has been limited progress in assessing \nAustralia’s ocean thermal energy resources. However, \nwith an enormous and varied coastline, and a \npopulation living predominantly in coastal areas, \nAustralia has huge potential for ocean and tidal energy.\n\nGovernment bodies and their functions\n\n■■ The Department of Environment and Energy is \nnow the chief government department regulating \nrenewable energy and climate change matters.  \nIt works alongside a host of other bodies at state \ngovernment and federal government level, such as  \nthe Clean Energy Regulator.\n\n■■ The Clean Energy Regulator, which has continued \nunder the current Malcolm Turnbull-led conservative \nGovernment, is as an independent statutory \nauthority under the Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011 \n(Cth). The regulator’s functions include managing the:\n\n – National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting \nScheme, under the National Greenhouse and Energy \nReporting Act 2007 (Cth);\n\n – Emissions Reduction Fund, under the Carbon Credits \n(Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth);\n\n – Renewable Energy Target, under the Renewable \nEnergy (Electricity) Act 2000 (Cth); and\n\n – Australian National Registry of Emissions Units, \nunder the Australian National Registry of Emissions \nUnits Act 2011 (Cth). \n\n■■ ARENA is another key government agency. ARENA is \nan independent authority that aims to, among other \nthings, improve the competitiveness of renewable \nenergy technologies and increase the supply of \nrenewable energy in Australia. It has supported \nnumerous solar and wind projects. \n\n■■ The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is an \nAustralian Government-owned ‘green bank’ \nestablished to provide a new source of finance for \nrenewable energy technologies, and to facilitate \nincreased flows of finance into the renewable \nenergy sector.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ In March 2017, in response to (perhaps exaggerated) \nfears of an “energy crisis” in Australia, Prime Minister \nMalcolm Turnbull announced a AU$2 billion (approx. \nUS$1.5 billion) expansion of the historic Snowy \nMountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. The announcement \ncame after a particularly intense period of energy \npolicy debate between major political parties \nand between State governments and the Federal \nGovernment. \n\n■■ Australia’s fifth most populous State, South Australia, \nhas become an important proving ground for \nAustralia’s renewable energy industry. It has some \nof the highest levels of wind and solar generation \nrelative to electricity demand of any region in the \nworld. Specifically, in 2014/15, wind accounted for \n37%, and solar photovoltaic installations generated \n7% of South Australia’s requirements. In September \n2016, South Australia experienced a State-wide \nblackout following fierce storms. Many blamed the \nblackout on an over-reliance on wind electricity, \nhowever the findings of the Australian Energy \nMarket Operator revealed that there were a number \nof factors, of which the renewables-heavy power \nmix was just one. In March 2017, South Australia’s \nPremier announced a AU$500 million (approx. \nUS$382.7 million) investment in a new, state-owned \n250MW gas-fired power station and the nation’s \nlargest battery farm (with a planned 100MW \ncapacity) in response to the perceived instability in \nthe State’s electricity supply. The State’s Premier \nthen confronted the federal Energy Minister over \nenergy issues at a press conference in March 2017.\n\n■■ Continued public debate on the RET has meant that \ninvestors perceive only a short window to benefit \nfrom current policy stability. It is clear Governments \nare in a bind – Australia has historically been reliant \non fossil fuels and mining is a major contributor to the \neconomy. Electricity prices, which are high by regional \ncomparisons in Australia, are a sensitive political issue. \nIt is often argued that any increase in renewables \ninvestment, at the expense of coal and natural gas, \nwill see an increase in electricity prices, and that any \ncarbon emissions reductions will be negligible on a \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 13\n\nglobal scale given Australia’s small population. The \ndebate will likely continue on, but for now the Federal \nGovernment line is to maintain the revised RET, and \nnote a modest increase in electricity prices may be \nexperienced. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\nRenewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (Cth)\n\n■■ This Act sets out Australia’s target of having \n20% renewable-sourced energy by 2020. The scheme \nestablished by the Act for achieving this target (the \nRET) aims to stimulate investment in renewables by \nrequiring liable entities (usually electricity retailers) \nto purchase and surrender a certain number of \nRenewable Energy Certificates (RECs), in order to \nmeet their obligation under the RET each year. RECs \nare created for each megawatt hour of renewable \nenergy generated or displaced.\n\n■■ Following a review of the RET, in 2011 the scheme \nwas split into two parts – the Large-Scale Renewable \nEnergy Target and the Small-Scale Renewable Energy \nScheme. Under the new scheme RECs were replaced \nby large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) \n(generated by large-scale renewables projects) and \nsmall-scale technology certificates (STCs) (generated \nby small-scale renewables systems).\n\n■■ LGCs are sold through the open LGC market, where \nprices fluctuate based on supply and demand and \nother market factors. Between April and December \n2016, the spot price of LGCs fluctuated between \nAU$80 and AU$90 (approx. US$60 and US$68). STCs \nmay either be sold through the open market for an \nuncapped price, or through the STC clearing house at \nthe fixed price of AU$40 (approx. US$30).\n\n■■ In June 2015, the Australian Parliament passed the \nRenewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Act 2015 \n(Cth). As part of the amendment Act, the 2020 \nLarge-Scale Renewable Energy Target was reduced \nfrom 41,000GWh to 33,000GWh, with interim \nand post-2020 targets adjusted accordingly. The \namendment Act also extended the partial exemption \nfor emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries to a \nfull exemption. The Small-Scale Energy Scheme has no \ntarget as such.\n\n■■ In its 2015 Administrative Report Annual Statement \n(as required under the Act), the Clean Energy \nRegulator reported that in 2015:\n\n – 15.2 million MWh was generated from large-scale \nrenewable sources; \n\n – 8.9 million MWh were generated or displaced from \nsmall-scale renewable systems; and\n\n – 12 different ecologically sustainable sources of \nrenewable electricity were used. \n\n■■ Overall, the Clean Energy Regulator found that \nAustralia’s progress was adequate under the \ncircumstances and that the Large-Scale Renewable \nEnergy Target in 2020 was achievable. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ LGCs and STCs, as discussed above, are the main \nFederal Government incentive for renewable energy \ninvestment in Australia. \n\n■■ ARENA has approximately AU$2 billion (approx. \nUS$1.5 billion) in government funding, which is \nlegislated until 2022.\n\n■■ In March 2016 the Australian Government established \nthe AU$1 billion (approx. US$765 million) Clean \nEnergy Innovation Fund. The fund, which will be \nmanaged by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and \nARENA, will make available AU$100 million (approx. \nUS$76.5 million) per year for 10 years to provide debt \nand equity for renewables projects, energy efficiency \nand low emissions technologies. Projects financed \nby the fund will be subject to a target rate of return \nand risk level to be prescribed by the Government. \nThe fund marks a shift in ARENA’s role from a pure \ngrant provider to a debt/equity funder. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ In June 2016, QIC announced a AU$800 million \n(approx. US$603.4 million) investment alongside AGL \nEnergy Limited in the Powering Australia Renewables \nFund (PARF). The PARF is an investment vehicle \ndeveloped to entice investors to contribute to a pool \nof around AU$2 to 3 billion (approx. US$1.53 to \n2.3 billion) to go towards investment in large-scale \nrenewable projects. It is anticipated that the PARF will \nassist AGL to meet its legislated obligations under the \n\n\n\n14 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRET by bringing approximately 1,000MW of renewable \nenergy capacity online. The PARF will provide power \npurchase agreements for five to 10 years. The fund is \nthe first of its kind in Australia. \n\n■■ In late-January 2017, Singapore-based firm Equis \nEnergy, which is Asia’s largest independent renewable \nenergy developer and investor, announced their \nAU$400 million (approx. US$306 million) plan to build \ntwo 100MW ‘battery ready’ solar plants in Australia. \nThe plants, which are set to be built in South Australia \nand Queensland, will be paired with fossil fuel power \ngeneration and transmission infrastructure. The \nSouth Australian plant will be paired with a new diesel \npowered plant near Tailem Bend, and the Queensland \nplant will be paired with the existing substation in \nCollinsville. In their announcement, Equis also stated \nthat they had plans for another 1,000MW worth of \nlarge-scale solar projects, to be built over the coming \nyears, for which they have already secured land rights. \n\n■■ In April 2016, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation \ntogether with Palisade Investment Partners announced \na strategy to accelerate the delivery of AU$1 billion \n(approx. US$765 million) in Australian renewable \nenergy projects. The strategy, which involves funds \nmanaged by Palisade, is aimed at obtaining institutional \ninvestment in renewable energy at an earlier stage \nof project development. The Clean Energy Finance \nCorporation will work with Palisade to identify \nsuitable renewable projects and build a portfolio. \nThe Clean Energy Finance Corporation is contributing \nan initial $100 million in equity while Palisade will \ncontribute AU$400 million (approx. US$306 million) \nin equity through its managed funds and its clients \n(including VicSuper and Qantas Super).\n\n■■ Hydro Tasmania, which is owned by the Tasmanian \nGovernment, is regarded as the largest renewable \nenergy generator in Australia. The company has \nproposed to build a 200MW wind farm on King Island \n(located between Tasmania and the Australian \nmainland), which could provide up to 25% of the \ninstalled generation capacity intended to be achieved \nby the RET. Hydro Tasmania put the AU$2 billion \n(approx. US$1.53 billion) project to a vote of the \nisland’s residents in mid-2013. The project received a \n58% approval rating.\n\n■■ The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme, which \nwas completed in 1974, is the largest engineering \nproject ever undertaken in Australia and regarded as \na ‘nation-building project’. It provides up to 10% of all \nelectricity in New South Wales. The scheme consists \nof 16 major dams, seven power stations, a pumping \nstation and 225km of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts. \nAs discussed above, the Federal Government (which \nowns 13% of the project) has proposed expanding the \nscheme for the first time since 1974. \n\n■■ There are currently a number of large-scale wind \nfarms under development throughout Australia.  \nIn North Queensland, construction of the 180MW \nMount Emerald wind farm has commenced; with a \nproposed 63 wind turbines, the project is valued at \nAU$406 million (U$311 million). Also planned for 2017 \nare Nexif Energy’s 212MW wind farm at Lincoln Gap, \nand a 90MW wind farm at Glen Innes.\n\n■■ OneWind Australia (a consortium of Denham \nCapital, Enersis Australia, National Power and Kato \nCapital), have recently amassed a 1GW portfolio of \nwind farm projects, including Glen Innes (100MW), \nLincoln Gap (250MW) and Cattle Hill (240MW). \nThe three projects have an estimated cost of \nAU$800 million (approx. US$612 million).\n\n■■ EnergyAustralia plans to sign power purchase \nagreements, worth an estimated AU$1.5 billion \n(approx. US$1.15 billion), for 500MW of wind and \nsolar energy from new renewable projects in eastern \nAustralia. EnergyAustralia has also agreed to purchase \nthe entire energy output from a 42.6MW solar \nfarm located in Manildra, New South Wales, with \nconstruction of the plant due to begin in early 2017 \nand expected to be completed by 2018.\n\n■■ AGL’s Nyngan and Broken Hill solar plants officially \nopened in January 2016 and in November 2016, AGL \nannounced on behalf of the PARF that it had reached \nfinancial close on selling its 102MW Nyngan and \n53MW Broken Hill solar plants into the fund. \nThe plants are Australia’s largest utility-scale \nsolar photovoltaic power plants, and will produce \napproximately 360,000MWh of renewable energy, \ncapable of powering more than 50,000 average \nAustralian homes. In a media release, AGL Managing \nDirector & CEO Andy Vesey stated that “[t]he two \nplants add to AGL’s credentials as Australia’s largest \n\n\n\nnon-government owner, operator and developer of \nrenewable energy generation with over 1,900MW of \nrenewable capacity currently in operation”.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Foreign direct investment in Australia amounted to \nAU$735 billion (approx. US$562 billion) at the end \nof 2015.\n\n■■ The Federal Government reviews foreign investment \nproposals against the national interest case-by-case \nthrough the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).\n\n■■ The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) \nprovides the legislative framework for the screening \nregime.\n\n■■ All foreign governments and their related entities \nshould notify the Australian Government and obtain \nprior approval before making a direct investment in \nAustralia, regardless of the value of the investment.\n\n■■ Australia’s thresholds for investment requiring FIRB \napproval depend on whether the investor is from \na country which has a free trade agreement with \n\nAustralia, and also on whether the investor is a \ngovernment or non-government entity. In general, \nalthough some exceptions apply, foreign persons \nshould notify the Australian Government before \nacquiring an interest of 15% or more in an Australian \nbusiness or corporation that is valued above \nAU$252 million (approx. US$192.8 million). It is also \nnecessary for persons to notify the Government \nif they wish to acquire an interest in an offshore \ncompany whose Australian subsidiaries or gross \nassets are valued above AU$252 million (approx. \nUS$192.8 million).\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Australia ratified the Paris Agreement on  \n9 November 2016 and committed to reducing \nemissions by 26 – 28% below 2005 levels by \n2030; which builds on its 2020 target of reducing \nemissions by 5% below 2000 levels. \n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 15\n\n\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Clean Energy Regulator – http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au// \n\n■■ Clean Energy Map – https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/technologies/renewable-energy-map.html \n\n■■ Australian Renewable Energy Agency – http://www.arena.gov.au/ \n\n■■ Department of the Environment and Energy – https://www.environment.gov.au/ \n\n■■ Energy White Paper 2015 – http://ewp.industry.gov.au/sites/prod.ewp/files/EnergyWhitePaper.pdf \n\n■■ RET Scheme – https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/renewable-energy-target-scheme \n\n■■ Clean Energy Australia Report 2015 – https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/policy-advocacy/reports/clean-energy-\naustralia-report.html \n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Clean Energy Regulator, Renewable Energy Target: 2015 Administrative Report and Annual Statement, accessed at: \nhttp://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/DocumentAssets/Documents/The%20Renewable%20Energy%20Target%20\n2015%20Administrative%20Report.pdf \n\n■■ Department of the Environment and Energy, Paris Agreement, accessed at: https://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/\ninsights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/ \n\n■■ DLA Piper, Investment trends in renewable energy in Australia, accessed at: https://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/\ninsights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/\n\n■■ Reegle, Country Energy Profile: Australia, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/australia-energy-profile/AU \n\n■■ ABC News, SA weather: Power ‘gradually’ returning after blackout plunged state into darkness, accessed at: \nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-weather-south-australia-without-power-as-storm-hits/7885930 \n\n■■ ABC News, SA power: Energy Ministry to be given more control in state’s $500 million plan to secure future, accessed at: \nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-14/sa-power-energy-minister-electricity-market-plan-jay-weatherill/8351450 \n\n16 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttp://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au//\nhttps://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/technologies/renewable-energy-map.html\nhttp://www.arena.gov.au/\nhttps://www.environment.gov.au/\nhttp://ewp.industry.gov.au/sites/prod.ewp/files/EnergyWhitePaper.pdf\nhttps://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/renewable-energy-target-scheme\nhttps://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/policy-advocacy/reports/clean-energy-australia-report.html\nhttps://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/policy-advocacy/reports/clean-energy-australia-report.html\nhttp://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/DocumentAssets/Documents/The Renewable Energy Target 2015 Administrative Report.pdf\nhttp://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/DocumentAssets/Documents/The Renewable Energy Target 2015 Administrative Report.pdf\nhttps://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/insights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/\nhttps://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/insights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/\nhttps://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/insights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/\nhttps://www.dlapiper.com/en/australia/insights/publications/2016/05/investment-trends-in-renewable-energy-in-australia/\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/australia-energy-profile/AU\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-28/sa-weather-south-australia-without-power-as-storm-hits/7885930\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-14/sa-power-energy-minister-electricity-market-plan-jay-weatherill/8351450\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Civil law\n\nLanguage: Mandarin, Cantonese and regional languages\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 78 of 190 (up 2 rankings) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 28 of 138 (no change) \n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 111 of 180 (up 33 rankings)\n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 79 of 176 (up 4 rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 90 of 188 (down 1 ranking)\n\nPopulation: 1.4 billion\n\nGNI per capita: US$7,930 \n\nPROFILE\n\nSince 1949, the world’s most populous country has been governed by the Communist Party of China. \nThe People’s Republic of China (China) has experienced rapid economic growth since Deng Xiaoping and \nHu Yaobang’s economic reforms and opening up that commenced in the late 1970s. China is now predicted \nto become the world’s largest economy (in GDP terms) by 2020. China’s economic liberalisation has seen \nan unprecedented rise in the average living standards of many Chinese citizens. However, a number of \nenvironmental, income disparity, geopolitical and energy security challenges have arisen. Under the leadership \nof President Xi Jinping, the Party’s 13th Five Year Plan (2016 – 2020) laid out plans to drive innovation, increase \ncompetition and continue with Premier Li Keqiang’s ‘War on Pollution’ by encouraging clean production and \ndiversifying China’s energy mix.\n\nPEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 17\n\n\n\n18 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ China is the world’s largest energy producer and \nnow also the world’s largest energy consumer. \nGiven its size, China-related data is difficult to verify. \nNonetheless, it was estimated that by the end of \n2014, China’s electricity capacity was 1,505GW \n(predominantly fossil fuel-based), while electricity \ngeneration was approximately 5,322TWh. \nThe 13th Five Year Plan (released in 2016) forecasts \nthat China’s net electricity generation will grow at an \nannual rate of 2.5%, doubling from 4.8 trillion kWh in \n2012 to 9.4 trillion kWh in 2040.\n\n■■ China is the largest producer and consumer of coal \nin the world. Much of China’s coal is consumed \ndomestically, which contributes significantly to the \ncountry’s air pollution problems. At the end of 2013, \ncoal accounted for 63% of China’s installed electricity \ncapacity, followed by hydropower at 22%, wind at \n6% and solar at 1%. The Chinese Government expects \ncoal’s share to decline to 53% by 2030, as renewable \nelectricity generation is ramped up by an average of \n3.8% a year.\n\n■■ China’s energy market also relies heavily on domestic \nand imported oil as well as natural gas.\n\n■■ Over 99% of Chinese households have access to \nelectricity.\n\nRegulators\n\n■■ China’s energy sector is overseen by a vast \nbureaucracy across a number of organisations at \nnational, provincial and local levels of government. \nThe National Energy Administration, which acts under \nthe management and supervision of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, is the major \nregulator of the energy sector. It is responsible for \nnation-wide energy development. \n\n■■ The National Energy Commission is an inter-\nministerial coordination committee created under \nthe auspices of the State Council (China’s chief \nadministrative authority), in charge of studying and \ndevising the nation’s energy development strategy, \nreviewing and examining key issues relating to energy \nsafety and development, and planning and coordinating \nmajor matters relating to domestic energy \n\ndevelopment and international energy cooperation. \nThe National Energy Commission is usually headed \nby China’s Premier, with a number of ministerial-level \nmembers.\n\n■■ By contrast, the National Energy Administration \nis more akin to a day-to-day regulator in charge of \nregulation and administrative matters.\n\nReforms\n\nIn the past 20 years, China’s power sector has undergone \nsignificant reforms:\n\n■■ In 2002, the Government divided the formerly \nmonolithic (and vertically integrated) State Power \nCorporation into 11 new corporations (including \ntwo grid companies, five power generation companies \nand four companies engaged in auxiliary businesses \nsuch as consulting and construction services). This has \nresulted in some competition in the wind and solar \nenergy generation sectors. However state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) continue to dominate the sector.\n\n■■ State Grid Corporation of China, the second largest \ncompany in the world by some measures and an SOE, \nhas taken on a ‘national champion’ role. The company \nhas already invested in a number of electricity markets \nacross the globe, including in Brazil, the Philippines, \nAustralia, Italy and Portugal.\n\n■■ In March 2013, the State Electricity Regulatory \nCommission (one of the main regulatory bodies in the \npower sector) was absorbed by the National Energy \nAdministration.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ There are five state-owned power generation \ncompanies: China Guodian Corporation, China \nHuaneng Group, China Datang Corporation, \nHuadian Corporation and State Power Investment \nCorporation.\n\n■■ Besides these five ‘giants’, there are other power \ncompanies of note, including CR Power Holding \nCompany, Guohua Electric Power Company, SDIC \nPower Holdings Co., Ltd and China General Nuclear \nPower Group.\n\nhttp://www.youdao.com/w/Portugal/#keyfrom=E2Ctranslation\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 19\n\n■■ More than 90% of the total installed generating \ncapacities are state-owned. More than 80% of \nelectricity is distributed by the State Grid Corporation \nof China and China Southern Power Grid. While \nSOEs remain the dominant players, the drive for SOE \nreform saw a number of ‘mixed-ownership’ pilot \nprojects approved in 2016.\n\n■■ Currently, China has six regional power grids. \nThe 13th Five Year Plan has also flagged further \ndevelopment in the network of smart grids and \nultra-high voltage power transmission.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electric Power Law 1995 (revised in 2015) is \nthe main legislative instrument applying to the \nconstruction, production, supply and utilisation of \nelectricity. As is customary in China’s legislative \ndrafting, the Law uses generic language, such as the \nneed to: \n\n – incorporate electric power development into \nnational and social development;\n\n – promote safe production of electricity;\n\n – promote the ‘hook-up’ between power-producing \nenterprises and electric networks (reserving \npriority in utilisation to the investor);\n\n – require contracts between suppliers and users of \nelectricity;\n\n – require unified pricing of electricity; and\n\n – adopt preferential policies for rural electrification.\n\n■■ The Energy Conservation Law 1998 also has a broad \nambit to promote energy efficiency and has led \nto over 164 “energy savings standards”, some of \nwhich are mandatory across the country. The Law \nwas amended in 2007 (and again in 2016), with the \namendments:\n\n – setting energy savings as a fundamental nation-wide \npolicy;\n\n – applying a system of responsibility to achieve the \ngoals of energy saving (including strengthening \ngovernment liabilities); and\n\n – adopting substantial incentive measures, such \nas allocating special funds for energy saving and \nintroducing preferable tax policies.\n\n■■ Other relevant regulations include: \n\n – Central Governmental Regulations, like the \nElectricity Supply and Utilisation Regulation (revised \nin 2016);\n\n – Market Supervision Regulations:\n\n° Regulation on Electric Power Supervision 2005;\n\n° Measures for the Supervision of Electric Power \nMarket 2005;\n\n° Basic Rules for Electric Power Market \nOperation 2005;\n\n° Interim Basic Rules for Medium and Long-Term \nElectricity Transactions (issued in December \n2016); and\n\n° Circular of the National Development and \nReform Commission, the Ministry of Finance \nand the National Energy Administration on the \nTrial Implementation of the Renewable Energy \nGreen Power Certificate Issuance and Voluntary \nSubscription Transaction System (issued in \nJanuary 2017); and\n\n – Pricing Regulations:\n\n° Interim Provisions for the Administration of \nFeed-in Tariff 2005;\n\n° Interim Provisions for the Administration of \nPower Transmission and Distribution Price 2005;\n\n° Interim Provisions for the Administration of \nPower Selling Price 2005; and\n\n° Interim Provisions for Inter-Regional Electric \nPower Transmission Price Review 2007.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ China remains a global leader in renewable energy in \nalmost every respect from total capacity, to current \nand future expenditure, and renewable technology \nproduction.\n\n\n\n■■ China has a goal of producing at least 15% of its \noverall energy output from renewable energy \nsources by 2020 and 20% by 2030. That push for \nrenewable energy is underscored by air quality \nconcerns, water and food contamination concerns \nas well as geopolitical concerns about energy supply \nroutes through the narrow Malacca Strait (as well as \nthe Lombok and Makassar Straits). As a result, it is \nestimated that between 2016 and 2020, China will \nspend US$363 billion on renewable power generation. \nIndeed, in 2015, China was the world’s largest investor \nin renewable energy, contributing 36% of the world’s \ntotal production.\n\n■■ Reportedly, at the end of 2016, China has revised its \n2020 renewables target, scaling back its ambitions in \nresponse to over-capacity issues. The rapid increase in \nrenewable electricity generation has left the Chinese \ngrid struggling to take on the additional power \nsupplies, while idled capacity has increased.\n\n■■ China is also the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the \nworld and now accounts for about one-fifth of global \ncarbon emissions. China has voluntarily committed to \nreducing its carbon intensity per unit of GDP by \n40 to 45% by 2020 compared to 2005 levels.\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ China has the largest total installed hydropower \ncapacity of any country at 319GW. It added more \ncapacity in 2015 than the rest of the world combined.\n\n■■ The Central Government’s aim is to have 420GW of \ninstalled hydropower by 2020.\n\n■■ The Three Gorges Dam includes 32 separate 700MW \ngenerators. It is the largest electricity producing \nfacility in the world and recently celebrated its \n1 trillionth kWh of output. \n\n■■ Mega-dam constructions have sometimes caused \nsocial unrest with residents opposing forced evictions \nand some complaints of insufficient compensation \npackages. Geologists have expressed concern over \nbuilding mega-dams in earthquake-prone areas, while \nenvironmentalists have continually lamented the \nimpact of dams on river ecosystems.\n\n■■ ‘Dam diplomacy’ has emerged as a significant and \ncomplex geopolitical issue for China and its relations \nwith downstream neighbours. Myanmar and China are \nstill deadlocked over the suspended Myitsone Dam \nProject, while India has expressed concern over the \nUS$750 million Lalho project in Tibet.\n\n20 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 21\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Between 2005 and 2012, China increased its wind \nenergy capacity almost 50-fold. Reportedly, by the end \nof 2015, China’s installed wind capacity was 145GW, \nthe largest of any nation. China’s windiest areas, which \ninclude Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu and Tibet, are \nlocated in the north and west, far from population \ncentres and thus require extensive transmission \ninfrastructure.\n\n■■ It is estimated that in the few years leading to 2016, \nan average of 36 wind turbines per day were erected \nin China. This installation level decreased slightly in \n2016, but still remains at over 24 wind turbines per \nday. China is however, experiencing wind energy \noversupply, with curtailment levels (idling wind \nturbines) occurring at a rate of 19%. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ China is now targeting 110GW of installed solar power \ncapacity by 2020, with the latest estimates from 2016 \nsuggesting solar capacity is around 77GW.\n\n■■ In 2015, China produced the world’s largest installed \ncapacity of photovoltaic power, with an annual growth \nrate of over 33% from 2011 to 2015.\n\n■■ Low interest rates and extended credit from local \nbanks as well as other government subsidies for land, \nresearch and development, have underpinned the \nsuccess of China’s solar industry.\n\n■■ China is the world’s largest manufacturer of solar \npanels, and Chinese private investment group China \nMinsheng New Energy Investment is in the process of \nbuilding the world’s largest solar photovoltaic panel \nfarm in China.\n\n■■ The majority of leading global solar panel makers are \nChinese. However, 2016 was the first year since 2013 \nthat exports of Chinese-made solar equipment fell. \n\n■■ The People’s Daily reported in February 2017 that \nState Power Investment Corporation had become \nthe world’s largest solar power generator by installed \ncapacity (approx. 7,100MW).\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ By 2020, China is expected to triple its geothermal \npower consumption, accounting for 1.5% of China’s \nenergy mix.\n\n■■ As of 2016, China had 27MW of installed geothermal \ngeneration capacity. The country is anticipating \ngrowth to 100MW of installed capacity by 2020. \nMost of China’s known high-temperature resources \nare located in Yunnan and Tibet, and geothermal \nexploration has been limited mostly to these \nprovinces.\n\nBiogas/biomass energy\n\n■■ Biogas digesters are seen as a solution to the dumping \nof animal waste in waterways. There have been \nmore than 1,600 large-scale digesters and more than \n30 million household biogas digesters constructed in \nChina.\n\n■■ China’s estimated installed capacity of biomass was \n8.5GW in 2013 and is expected to reach 30GW \nby 2030.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ China’s National Emissions Trading System is predicted \nto launch in the second half of 2017. Local regulations \nindicate companies exceeding an allotted amount of \ncarbon emissions will be fined, whereas companies \nemitting less carbon than the allotted levels can \nsell the surplus. It is hoped that this system has the \npotential to incentivise other countries to implement \ncarbon pricing policies, ultimately assisting the \nimplementation of the Paris Agreement.\n\n■■ China continues to grapple with the need to improve \nthe utilisation of existing wind and solar farms given \nreports of idle capacity. In part, this problem has \narisen due to inefficient processing, storage and \ntransportation methods. Grid upgrades have not kept \npace with wind and solar power station developments. \nThis has resulted in transmission capacity lags and \nproblems with grid integration and transmission \ninfrastructure. The vast geographical separation \n\n\n\n22 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nbetween the major renewable farms in rural north and \nwestern China and the densely populated eastern and \nsouthern coasts has also contributed to the problem.\n\n■■ The Chinese Government has recognised that idle \ncapacity of renewable farms is linked to the continual \nprioritisation of coal energy supplies. Consequently, \nin March 2016, the National Energy Administrator \nannounced a nine point plan to reduce curtailment \nand increase uptake of renewable energy in northern \nChina. In 2016, the National Development and \nReform Commission promulgated the Administrative \nMeasures for the Guaranteed Purchase of Renewable \nEnergy Power, a regulation which requires power grid \ncompanies to purchase a minimum quota of renewable \nenergy. In 2016, the National Energy Administrator \nreportedly banned the construction of new wind \nfarms in regions with the most significant grid \nintegration issues. \n\n■■ In 2016, the Central Government announced it would \ndelay the construction of coal-fired power plants \nin fifteen regions and suspend the approval of new \nprojects in around thirteen provinces until 2018. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Renewable Energy Law 2006 includes provisions \nregarding price regulation, differentiated pricing, special \nfunds and tax relief. Importantly, under the Law, state-\nowned grid operators are required to purchase all the \nenergy output generated from approved renewable \ngenerators (to the extent that output is delivered to \nthe grid).\n\n■■ The Law was most recently revised in 2009 with some \nof the key changes including:\n\n – requiring the existing provincial-level renewable \nenergy development and utilisation plans to be \nsubmitted to the competent energy departments of \nthe State Council and the national power regulatory \nauthorities for filing;\n\n – implementing a protective full-purchase system for \nrenewable energy power; and\n\n – setting-up a renewable energy development fund.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The National Development and Reform Commission \nintroduced a new feed-in tariff scheme which became \neffective from 1 January 2017. Significantly, the \nnew scheme indirectly reduces the fixed subsidies \nfor solar projects. These cuts reflect the lessening \nproduction and equipment costs required to establish \nrenewable energy projects given recent technological \nadvancements. \n\n■■ In order to deal with curtailment and grid integration \nproblems, new government guidance provides \nminimum electricity consumption targets for non-\nhydro renewable energy. Targets of between 5 to \n13% have been set for 31 provinces to incentivise the \nintegration of renewable energy, and the proportion \nof non-hydro renewable energy in the national \nelectricity consumption is expected to be 9% by 2020. \n\n■■ Since 2009, the Chinese Government has had an \nincentive program to encourage the production and \npurchase of hybrid or electric vehicles. However, in \n2016, after reports surfaced of companies incorrectly \nobtaining the generous subsidies (for example by \ninflating the number of electric vehicles produced), \ntougher revised policies are said to be in the pipeline \nwith the intention of eventually phasing out subsidies.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ China Huadian Corporation has begun construction \nof the first hydropower station with a capacity of \nmore than 1,000MW in Tibet Autonomous Region. \nThe project is known as the Suwalong hydro power \nproject, and is due to be completed in 2020. \n\n■■ The largest solar farm in the world with a capacity \nof 2GW is under construction in China’s northwest \nregion of Ningxia by China Minsheng Investment \nGroup. \n\n■■ Since 2015, the Chinese company BYD has become \nthe world’s largest electric car manufacturer. BYD, \nalong with another Chinese firm, Contemporary \nAmperex Technology Co., Limited, continue to \njostle with Tesla for the front running position in \ntechnological advancements and design of electric \nvehicles and lithium ion batteries.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 23\n\n■■ In December 2016, Apple Inc announced its plan \nto completely power its China supply chain with \nrenewable energy through a partnership with \nGoldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd, the world’s \nlargest wind turbine maker.\n\n■■ Many Chinese companies are looking outside China \nto invest in renewable energy particularly now that \nthe domestic market is facing a lull after numerous \nyears of rapid development. Some notable investments \nmade by Chinese companies in 2016 were for projects \nin countries including Australia, Germany, Brazil, \nChile, Indonesia and Egypt. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Catalogue for Guidance of Foreign Investment, \namended in 2015, requires foreign investment be made \nin a manner that is consistent with Chinese policy \nand in a way that will promote the development of \nChina. Importantly, alternative energy and energy \nefficient technology investment are included in \nthe ‘encouraged’ category. However, there are \nstill barriers for foreign investment in the nuclear \npower generation and grid industry, such as the \nneed to create joint ventures with and controlled by \nChinese companies. Even in renewable energy power \ngeneration, foreign investors may be asked to partner \nwith a local company, although this is not compulsory. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ China ratified the Paris Agreement on 3 September \n2016 and is committed to ensuring its carbon dioxide \nemissions peak as soon as possible. By 2030, China \naims to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions per unit \nof GDP by 60 to 65% as measured against 2005 levels. \nChina has also pledged to increase the use of non-\nfossil fuel energy so that it accounts for 20% of total \nenergy consumption by 2020 and promised to achieve \nthe elimination of fossil fuels by 2100. China aims to \nincrease the amount of forestry stock by 4.5 billion \ncubic metres as compared to 2005 stocks.\n\n■■ China announced that it intends to spend around \nUS$363 billion on renewable energy development \nby 2020 to achieve what it has pledged in the Paris \n\nAgreement. The National Energy Administration \nconfirmed that China will focus investment on \ndeveloping solar and wind power energy sources, and \nin doing so, aims to create 13 million new jobs in the \nrenewable energy sector. \n\n\n\n24 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ National Development and Reform Commission – http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/ \n\n■■ State Electricity Regulatory Commission – http://www.serc.gov.cn/english/index.htm \n\n■■ National Energy Administration – http://www.nea.gov.cn/ \n\n■■ China Renewable Energy Industries Association – http://www.creia.net/index.html \n\n■■ China Climate Change Info-Net – http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/ \n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, China’s Global Renewable Energy Expansion, accessed at: \nhttp:// eefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chinas-Global-Renewable-Energy-Expansion_January-2017.pdf \n\n■■ Javier c.

Kong) is a major global trade hub and financial centre. \nIt was formerly a British territory until it was ‘handed-over’ or ‘returned’ to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. \nSince that time, under the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, Hong Kong has held a unique political \nand economic position, often facilitating trade between China and the West. Hong Kong enjoys a level of \nautonomy and operates political and judicial systems that are, in most respects, independent from mainland \nChina. However, in 2014, there were large, student-led protests against perceived interference from Beijing in \nHong Kong’s political processes. \n\nHONG KONG SAR\n\n\n\n26 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Hong Kong has no locally-sourced energy resources. \nThis, coupled with a scarcity of land, means that \nHong Kong is heavily dependent on both direct energy \nimports (oil and coal products) and imported fuel \ninputs (gas and electricity). \n\n■■ Hong Kong’s electricity system is independent from \nmainland China, although Hong Kong does import \napproximately 23% of its total electricity needs from \ngenerating facilities situated on the mainland (some of \nthese facilities are partly owned by CLP Power Hong \nKong Limited (CLP), one of the two major companies \nresponsible for generating power in Hong Kong).\n\n■■ Hong Kong’s electricity consumption per capita is just \nunder 6kWh. This electricity consumption is divided \nbetween commercial (66%), domestic (27%) and \nindustrial (7%).\n\n■■ Coal continues to dominate the fuel mix for power \ngeneration (about 57%), followed by nuclear power \n(22%) and natural gas (21%). \n\n■■ In response to public consultation on future fuel mix \noptions in 2014, the Hong Kong Government aims to \nincrease natural gas generation to 50% by 2020, and \nreducing coal generation to 25%. Many of the existing \ncoal plants will start to be phased out in 2017. \n\n■■ The increase in electricity consumption in Hong Kong \nhas slowed in recent years due, in part, to the \nimplementation of energy efficiency programs.\n\n Electricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Ordinance (Cap 406) regulates the \nsupply of electricity. It covers the registration of \ngenerating facilities, contractors and workers for \nelectrical installations, wiring installation standards and \nthe safe distribution and use of electricity.\n\n■■ A non-statutory Energy Advisory Committee was set \nup in July 1996 to advise the Hong Kong Government \non energy policy, including policy matters concerning \nenergy supply and demand, as well as energy \nconservation and efficiency. The committee will \ncontinue in its current form until July 2018.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ Electricity is supplied exclusively by the private sector, \nnamely CLP and The Hongkong Electric Company \nLimited (HEC). These companies are vertically \nintegrated, handling all aspects of the electricity \nsupply chain including generation, transmission, and \ndistribution.\n\n■■ Electricity supply in Hong Kong is regulated through \nScheme of Control Agreements. The most recent \nagreements were entered into by the Hong Kong \nGovernment with CLP and HEC respectively on  \n7 January 2008. The current agreements will be in \neffect until 30 September 2018 and 31 December 2018 \nrespectively.\n\n■■ The agreements ensure that the Government can \nmonitor and regulate the performance, reliability \nand financial affairs of the power companies. The \nagreements do not confer exclusive rights to supply \nelectricity on CLP and HEC. However the lack of \navailable land on which a new generating station may \nbe built presents a barrier for new entrants to the \nelectricity market. The result is that the electricity \nmarket is controlled by a regulated duopoly.\n\n■■ Some commentators have argued that the rate of \nreturn in the agreements is too high and does not \nprovide sufficient incentives for power companies to \nsource the cheapest fuel available nor to make a great \nenough effort to develop renewable energy facilities. \n\n■■ With the agreements expiring in 2018, many see it as \nan important opportunity for reform in the electricity \nsector and to explore renewable energy options.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Renewable energy accounts for just 1 to 3% of the fuel \nmix for the supply of electricity in Hong Kong. In 2010, \nthe Hong Kong Government set a target of 4.32% of \nrenewable energy in the overall fuel mix by 2020. This \ntarget was proposed in tandem with Hong Kong’s \nvoluntary target to reduce its carbon intensity by 50 \nto 60% by 2020 and by 65 to 70% by 2030 (based on \n2005 levels). \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 27\n\n■■ The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, \nthrough its Energy Efficiency Office, monitors the \nusage of energy and provides statistics and resources \nconcerning renewable energy in Hong Kong. Its \npurpose is to facilitate the wider adoption of \nrenewable technologies in Hong Kong.\n\n■■ Hong Kong lacks suitable rivers, good tidal conditions \nor geothermal resources. The high-density urban \nenvironment in the city also creates difficulties for \nsolar energy facilities.\n\n■■ The Government has nonetheless addressed \nenergy conservation issues. Since 2005, the Hong \nKong Government has required renewable energy \ntechnologies to be considered during the design and \nconstruction of any new building, as well as during any \nmajor retrofit of an existing building. The Government \ndeveloped an energy efficiency program known \nas the “Energy Saving Plan for Hong Kong’s Built \nEnvironment from 2015~2025+”. The plan sets targets \nfor the reduction in energy consumption for 2025 \nand 2035.\n\n■■ In recognition of the difficulty that Hong Kong faces \nin producing renewable energy, the current policy of \nthe Hong Kong Government is to adopt solar or wind \nfacilities for demonstration purposes, subject to their \ncost-effectiveness and meeting operational needs.\n\n■■ Electricity generation accounts for approximately \ntwo-thirds of Hong Kong’s greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ The water resources in Hong Kong are not feasible \nfor developing large-scale hydro projects. This is \ndue to the fact that most of Hong Kong’s rivers and \nwaterways are located within country parks and \nspecial conservation areas.\n\n■■ There are some locations that may be suitable for \nthe development of small or micro-hydro systems, \nincluding the Tuen Mun Water Treatment Works.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ The first commercial-scale wind power station in \nHong Kong was commissioned by HEC and completed \nin February 2006 on Lamma Island. Other than \nthis project, the development of wind energy in \nHong Kong remains largely stagnant. \n\n■■ HEC and CLP have both filed proposals for offshore \nwind farms. Although environmental permits for both \nproposed wind projects have been issued, neither CLP \nor HEC have made further progress on the projects \nsince 2013. Both companies state they are continuing \nwith feasibility studies.\n\n■■ CLP’s wind farm project, which was to be located \napproximately 9km east of Clearwater Bay peninsula \nwithin the south-eastern waters of Hong Kong, \n\n\n\n28 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\ninitially aimed for 67 wind turbines with a total \ncapacity of 200MW. The estimated cost of the project \nis HK$7 billion (approx. US$901.2 million). \n\n■■ HEC was granted an environmental permit in 2010 for \nits project, namely a 100MW capacity offshore facility \nclose to Lamma Island. HEC initially estimated that the \nwind farm would be commissioned in 2015.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ According to the International Energy Agency,  \nHong Kong utilised 1GWh of solar photovoltaic \npower in 2014. \n\n■■ Solar energy facilities have been gradually integrated \ninto buildings in Hong Kong since the late 1970s. Since \nthe 1980s, solar cells have been employed to generate \npower for weather stations in remote locations in \nHong Kong (although some of these stations have \nmore recently switched to wind power). \n\n■■ Building-integrated photovoltaic systems have been \nused in Hong Kong, both in Government and private \nstructures, sometimes with connections to the grid \nand sometimes working in tandem with a small wind \nturbine placed on top of the building. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ There are no known geothermal energy sources for \npower generation in Hong Kong. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ According to the International Energy Agency, \nHong Kong utilised 96GWh of biogas-generated \nelectricity in 2014. \n\n■■ Biogas energy production facilities have been \nintegrated into the Hong Kong Drainage Services \nDepartment’s sewage treatment facilities since 2006. \nIn 2014, those facilities generated over 28 million kWh \n– or the equivalent electricity consumption of 3,100 \nhouseholds. The resulting power generation was used \nwithin the sewage treatment facilities.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 29\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Hong Kong has a low tidal range, and consequently, \nrelatively low potential for generating tidal energy. \nDespite the development of specialised tidal turbines \nwhich are adapted to the low currents in Hong Kong’s \nwaters, tidal and ocean energy is unlikely to be a \nsignificant renewable energy source for Hong Kong.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ The stagnation of offshore wind projects in \nHong Kong suggests there is limited private sector \nappetite and government incentives for renewable \nenergy projects in the territory. Hong Kong \nnonetheless has some of the world’s most affordable \nand reliable electricity. \n\n■■ In 2014, CLP launched Asia’s first home energy \nmanagement scheme, which encourages customers to \nreduce their consumption. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Under the current scheme of control agreements, \ngeneration companies have a higher rate of return per \nkWh of electricity generated using renewable energy, \ncompared with fossil fuel-based electricity. \n\n■■ Since 2008, the Hong Kong Government has also been \nproviding tax incentives on the capital expenditure \nincurred in relation to the installation of renewable \nenergy power systems on private premises. Such \ncapital expenditure can be deducted over a five year \nperiod, starting from the year of purchase.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS\n\n■■ Hong Kong’s first wind/solar hybrid plant was installed \nat the Shek Kwu Chau Drug Rehabilitation Centre by \nthe CLP Research Institute. \n\n■■ The first commercial-scale combined photovoltaic and \nwind turbine hybrid plant was installed on Town Island \nin 2011, and has a capacity of 200kW.\n\n■■ The largest solar photovoltaic system operates at the \nLamma Island power plant. It has a total capacity of \n550kW and is expected to generate 620,000kWh of \nelectricity annually.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Apart from certain restrictions applicable to the \nbanking, civil aviation and broadcasting sectors, there \nare almost no restrictions on foreign investment, \nincluding in the energy sector. Therefore, it is possible, \nand common, to have 100% foreign equity ownership. \n\n■■ Hong Kong is generally seen as an attractive centre for \nforeign investment in Asia owing to its relatively low \ntaxes, good business infrastructure and proximity to \nmainland China. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ China ratified the Paris Agreement on  \n3 September 2016. As decided by the Central \nGovernment in Beijing, the Paris Agreement also \napplies to Hong Kong and as such Hong Kong will \nplay a part to help fulfil the obligations that China \nhas under the Paris Agreement. Accordingly China’s \nIntended Nationally Determined Contribution, which \ncommits to a 60 to 65% reduction in carbon dioxide \nemissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, informs \nHong Kong’s own carbon reduction targets. \n\n■■ Hong Kong’s current target, updated since the Paris \nAgreement, is to reduce its carbon intensity by 65 to \n70% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. \n\n\n\n30 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Hong Kong Government renewable energy page – http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/environment/energy/\nrenewableenergy.htm \n\n■■ Energy Saving Plan for Hong Kong’s Built Environment 2015~2025+ – http://www.enb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/pdf/\nEnergySavingPlanEn.pdf \n\n■■ Hong Kong Climate Change Report 2015 – http://www.enb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/pdf/ClimateChangeEng.pdf\n\n■■ Planning Ahead for a Better Fuel Mix: Future Fuel Mix for Electricity Generation – http://www.enb.gov.hk/sites/\ndefault/files/en/node2605/Consultation%20Document.pdf\n\n■■ Public Consultation on the Future Development of the Electricity Market – http://www.enb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/\nen/node3428/EMR_condoc_e.pdf\n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Energy Statistics 2015, accessed at: http://www.statistics.gov.hk/pub/\nB11000022015AN15B0100.pdf\n\n■■ Cheung Chi-Fai, CLP Power pushes back construction of Sai Kung wind farm for study, accessed at: http://www.scmp.\ncom/news/hong-kong/article/1336136/clp-power-pushes-back-construction-sai-kung-wind-farm-study \n\n■■ Deloitte, Taxation and Investment in Hong Kong 2016, accessed at: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/\nglobal/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-hongkongguide-2016.pdf\n\n■■ Dr. K.M.

It is regarded as a key emerging market given its enormous, \nyouthful population and continued economic growth. The election of Narendra Modi as India’s Prime Minister \nin May 2014 saw renewed focus on modernising India’s industry and energy sectors. Since 2014 India’s political \nagenda has been characterised by rapid economic development and increased participation in international \ndialogues. The country nonetheless faces issues of widespread poverty, energy shortages, overpopulation in \nsome areas and continued tensions with its neighbour, Pakistan. \n\nINDIA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 31\n\n\n\n32 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ As of 31 January 2017, India’s total installed generation \ncapacity stood at 314.64GW, of which:\n\n – coal (59.9%), oil (0.3%) and gas (8.1%) accounted for \n68.3%;\n\n – hydropower (excluding small hydro projects) \naccounted for 14%; \n\n – nuclear accounted for 1.8%; and\n\n – renewable energy (including small hydropower \nprojects) accounted for 15.9%.\n\n■■ In the Central Government’s 12th Plan (2012 – 2017), \nIndia is aiming to add 72.34GW, 10.9GW, and 5.3GW \nof additional capacity in the thermal, hydropower and \nnuclear sectors respectively. It is also aiming to add \n69.28GW and 2.54 GW of additional capacity for coal \nand gas.\n\n■■ The Indian National Electricity Policy 2005 (NEP), \nestablished under the Electricity Act 2003, is the \noverarching policy for the development of India’s \nenergy sector. The NEP outlines the importance \nof meeting electricity demands, securing supply, \nmitigating climate change, promoting renewable \nenergy sources and protecting the interests of \nconsumers and stakeholders.\n\n■■ India is the world’s third largest energy consumer \nbehind China and the US. However, electrification \nrates remain low, with about one-quarter of the \npopulation (roughly 300 million people) not having \nreliable access to electricity. The International Energy \nAgency estimates that to meet this demand, India will \nadd between 600GW to 1,200GW of additional new \npower generation capacity by 2050.\n\n■■ With a rapidly expanding economy and an ever-\nincreasing demand for electricity, India is facing \nsignificant energy security issues. The International \nEnergy Agency anticipates that oil demand will increase \nmore than in any other country, approaching 10 million \nbarrels per day by 2040, whilst India will also become \nthe world’s largest importer of coal by 2020, overtaking \nJapan, the European Union and China.\n\n■■ Electricity prices are regarded by some analysts as \nunsustainably low (US$0.08 per kWh). In 2016, solar \nenergy prices in the country dropped to around parity \nwith coal.\n\n■■ Electricity theft is also prevalent, which reduces \nincentives for investment in the energy sector.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Act 2003 and the Energy Conservation Act \n2001, as well as the rules and regulations made under \nthose acts, primarily govern the legislative framework \nof the electricity sector in India.\n\n■■ The Electricity Act 2003 consolidates the laws relating \nto the generation, transmission, distribution, trading \nand use of electricity. The Act has a number of \nimportant features, namely it:\n\n – recognises and regulates generation, transmission, \ndistribution and trading of electricity;\n\n – removes the requirement for a generation licence \nfor entities engaged in electricity generation \nprovided that such entities comply with the technical \nstandards regarding grid connectivity;\n\n – provides for private participation in the generation, \ntransmission, distribution and trading of electricity;\n\n – requires the State Electricity Regulatory \nCommissions to set out a minimum percentage of \nelectricity to be purchased from renewable sources \nby formulating regulations;\n\n – mandates control of the electricity supply through \nload despatch centres at inter-state and intra-state \nlevels by the Central and State Government entities;\n\n – mandates a non-discriminatory open access regime \nfor the transmission and distribution of electricity;\n\n – establishes the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity; and\n\n – makes provision for penal sanctions for the theft of \nelectricity.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 33\n\nGeneration\n\n■■ India’s total electricity generation stands at over \n300GW, with 40% of electricity capacity being \nprovided privately.\n\n■■ The Central Government entities providing \nelectricity generation include the National Thermal \nPower Corporation, the National Hydroelectric \nPower Corporation Limited and the Nuclear Power \nCorporation of India Limited.\n\n■■ Each State also has at least one generation company, \nexamples of which include Telangana Power \nGeneration Corporation and Andhra Pradesh Power \nGeneration Corporation Limited.\n\n■■ Entities are generally not required to have a licence \nto generate electricity, except in relation to nuclear \nprojects and certain hydropower projects. \n\n■■ The private sector is able to commission coal, gas \nor oil, hydropower, wind, solar and other renewable \nenergy-based projects of any size. However, only \nCentral Government owned and controlled entities \nare permitted to build and operate nuclear energy \nprojects. Currently, only the National Power \nCorporation generates electricity using nuclear \nenergy.\n\nDistribution and transmission\n\n■■ The distribution and transmission system in India is \na unique three-tier system consisting of distribution \nnetworks, state grids and regional grids. \n\n■■ The state grids are interconnected to form regional \ngrids. These regional grids are divided according to \nfive geographical areas: western, northern, eastern, \nnorth-eastern and southern. The regional grids are \ngradually being integrated to form a national grid to \nenable inter-regional transmission of power. The lack \nof a national grid is one contributing factor to the \nfrequent electricity outages in parts of India.\n\n■■ A non-discriminatory, open-access obligation is \nimposed on the distribution and transmission entities \nto encourage competition among generators, \n\ndistributors and traders in electricity from regions \nthat have a surplus of electricity to regions with an \nelectricity deficit.\n\n■■ Each state-owned transmission entity has a monopoly \nover the intra-state electricity transmission system. \nFor example, the Power Grid Corporation of India \nLimited operates approximately 130,000km of inter-\nstate transmission lines.\n\n■■ The Asian Development Bank has offered a \nUS$500 million low-interest loan to India to  \nimprove transmission lines across the country. \n\n■■ Engaging in transmission of electricity requires a \nlicence from the Central Electricity Regulatory \nCommission for inter-state transmission activity and \nthe relevant State Electricity Regulatory Commissions \nfor intra-state transmission activity. \n\n■■ Transmission licensees are prohibited from engaging in \nthe trading and distribution of electricity.\n\n■■ Distribution of electricity in India is controlled by the \nStates. Public and private entities intending to engage \nin the distribution of electricity are required to obtain \na licence from the relevant State Electricity Regulatory \nCommission.\n\nRegulatory bodies\n\n■■ The Ministry of Power has a number of regulatory \nfunctions, including:\n\n – administering the Electricity Act 2003; \n\n – monitoring and updating the National Electricity \nPolicy;\n\n – setting the rural electrification policy and tariff policy \nin consultation with the State Governments and the \nCentral Electricity Authority; and\n\n – overseeing the Central Government entities in the \nelectricity sector.\n\n■■ The Central Electricity Authority performs several \nfunctions, including:\n\n – advising the Central Government entities on matters \nrelating to the National Electricity Policy;\n\n\n\n34 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n – specifying the technical standards and safety \nrequirements for construction, operation and \nmaintenance of electrical plants and electric lines \nthrough regulations; and\n\n – promoting research in relation to matters affecting \nthe generation, transmission, distribution and \ntrading of electricity.\n\n■■ The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has a \nnumber of responsibilities, including:\n\n – making regulations in accordance with the grid \nstandards specified by the Central Electricity \nAuthority (including the Grid Code);\n\n – enforcing standards of quality, continuity and \nreliability of service by licensees;\n\n – regulating the tariffs of Central Government entities \nand private entities engaged in sale of electricity in \nmore than one State;\n\n – regulating the tariffs for inter-state transmission of \nelectricity;\n\n – acting as a licensing authority for granting electricity \ntransmission and trading licences regarding inter-\nstate operations; and\n\n – adjudicating disputes involving generating entities \nand transmission licensees in respect of the \naforementioned matters and referring any such \ndispute for arbitration.\n\n■■ The State Electricity Regulatory Commissions have \nresponsibility to make regulations, act as the regulator, \nand to fulfil quasi-judicial functions concerning intra-\nstate matters. The State Electricity Regulatory \nCommissions are also responsible for:\n\n – granting the electricity transmission, distribution \nand trading licences in respect of their intra-state \noperations;\n\n – stipulating the general and special conditions of the \nlicence;\n\n – revoking licences or selling licences through bidding;\n\n – regulating the tariff of generating stations owned by a \nstate government entity or by generating companies;\n\n – regulating the intra-state transmission and supply of \nelectricity; and\n\n – promoting co-generation and generation of \nelectricity from renewable energy sources by \nproviding suitable grid connectivity measures and \nregulating the sale of such electricity. In this respect, \nthe State Electricity Regulatory Commissions are \nrequired to specify the renewable energy purchase \nobligation for distribution licensees (both private and \nstate-owned), open access consumers and captive \npower plants.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ India’s energy use has almost doubled since 2000, \ncreating a need for innovative technologies in the \nenergy sector. \n\n■■ The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) \nis responsible for developing and promoting renewable \ntechnologies and renewable energy use in India.\n\n■■ India has seen a significant increase in installed \nrenewable energy capacity in the last ten years, \ngrowing from 10.3GW in March 2007 to 42.9GW in \nMarch 2016.\n\n■■ India’s National Electricity Plan 2016 set India an \nambitious new target of reaching a total installed \ncapacity of 175GW by 2022, with 100GW of that \ncapacity expected to be drawn from solar power. \n\n■■ It is predicted that by 2027, 43% of India’s electricity \ncapacity will come from renewable sources. A further \n39% will be drawn from coal, 11% from large hydro, 5% \nfrom gas and 2% from nuclear energy.\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ India’s overall installed hydropower capacity as at \n31 March 2016 was approximately 47.1GW, with a \nfurther 45 schemes amounting to 12GW of additional \ncapacity under construction.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 35\n\n■■ Over 90% of India’s hydropower capacity is generated \nby large hydropower projects – projects with a \ncapacity of more than 25MW.\n\n■■ A number of small hydropower projects, which are \ngoverned by the MNRE, are also in operation or in the \nplanning stages in India’s northern Himalayan regions.\n\n■■ India’s draft 10 year energy blueprint identifies \navailability of land, displacement caused by \nsubmergence and technical/infrastructure challenges \nas key issues for developers of hydropower projects \nin the country.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ India boasts the world’s fourth largest installed wind \npower capacity, exceeded only by China, the USA and \nGermany. \n\n■■ India’s installed wind power capacity as at December \n2016 stood at 28.7GW.\n\n■■ Between April 2016 and December 2016, India \nincreased its installed wind energy capacity by 2GW.\n\n■■ The MNRE has in recent years removed the \nregulatory requirement that wind installations only \ntake place at sites with a minimum wind power density \nof 200W/m2, which has paved the way for smaller wind \npower projects to play a role in the market.\n\n■■ In 2015, the MNRE released a national offshore wind \npolicy which stated that offshore wind energy is now \ncost-competitive with fossil fuel generated energy.  \nThe Global Wind Energy Council has released a \nreport which has stated that, as of December 2016, \nno offshore wind farms were under construction.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ High solar radiation levels, particularly in western \nregions of India, make solar energy an attractive \noption. Solar power has seen the sharpest growth in \ncapacity of all renewables sub-sectors in recent years.\n\n■■ As of 31 January 2017, the installed solar capacity of \n9GW was enough to meet 1% of overall electricity \ndemand.\n\n■■ New solar installations in India are expected to total \n4.8GW in 2016-17, with approximately 21GW of \ndevelopments in the planning stage.\n\n■■ A significant achievement in recent years has been \nestablishment of the International Solar Alliance \nin 2015. Headquartered in India, the Alliance has \n121 members (as at January 2017) and was established \non the initiative of Indian Prime Minister Narendra \nModi.\n\n■■ The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has \nbeen influential. The Mission aims to increase solar \ndeployment to 100GW by 2022. This new target, \nwhich has been extended significantly from the \nmission’s original 20GW goal, is considered ambitious.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Geothermal power use in India is minimal, and solely \nlimited to private, direct use. The Geological Survey \nof India suggests that India has 10GW of geothermal \nenergy potential that remains largely unexploited.\n\nBiomass energy\n\n■■ India has significant potential for biomass \nenergy production, due largely to its significant \nagricultural base.\n\n■■ According to the International Energy Agency, in \n2015, biomass accounted for 24% of India’s primary \nenergy demand. Many people in rural areas continue \nto rely on solid biomass fuels for cooking and heating. \nHowever this demand has declined comparatively \nsince 2000 due to increased availability of coal and \nother fuel sources.\n\n■■ The MNRE estimates India’s biomass power potential \nat 18GW, with approximately 500 million metric \ntonnes available each year, largely drawn from \nagricultural and forestry residue. An additional 7GW \nof power could be generated through bagasse based \ncogeneration in India’s 550 sugar mills.\n\n\n\n36 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ India has recently taken steps toward utilising its \ncoastlines to harness ocean energy.\n\n■■ The MNRE estimates India’s tidal energy potential is \n40GW, and wave energy potential is 9GW.\n\n■■ While no ocean energy projects are currently \nunderway, a number of projects have been proposed \nor remain under consultation. As an example, Atlantis \nenergy in 2014 announced a proposal to install a tidal \npower plant in the Gulf of Chambey with a capacity of \nup to 200MW.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Sustainably funding India’s enormous proposed \nexpansion in renewable technologies is likely the most \npressing issue facing developers. To date, international \ninvestment and multilateral cooperation has been \na primary source of backing. This trend is likely to \ncontinue in meeting India’s 2022 targets.\n\n■■ In recent decades, submersion and displacement \nof communities as a result of large hydropower \nprojects has been a topic of protest domestically \nand internationally. For example, it is estimated that \nthe Sardar Sarovar Dam on India’s Narmada river \ndisplaced 250,000 people, leading the World Bank to \nwithdraw its financial support.\n\n■■ Electricity theft continues to be prevalent in India. \nThis disincentivises both consumers and developers \nfrom investing in potentially more expensive green \nenergy technologies.\n\n■■ The vast amounts of land needed for viable \nrenewables projects is also an ongoing issue for \nrenewable energy projects, given the relatively high \ncompetition for land in India.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Central Government of India has taken \nsteps toward creating a unified legal framework \nfor renewable energy. In July 2015 the Central \nGovernment released the Draft National Renewable \nEnergy Act 2015 (NREA).\n\n■■ Measures set out in the NREA include creation of a \nNational Renewable Energy Committee to oversee \nimplementation of renewable energy policies and \nensure coordination between government and private \nstakeholders.\n\n■■ As at January 2017, the NREA had not yet been passed \ninto law.\n\n■■ Currently promotion and regulation of renewable \nenergy is incorporated in the Electricity Act 2003.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The Central Government has been proactive in \nestablishing tax incentives for renewable energy \ndevelopers and investors. These include the MNRE’s \ngeneration based incentive schemes, which make \nrenewable projects eligible for incentives of INR10 \nmillion (approx. US$1.54 million) per MW of power \nfed into India’s electricity grid.\n\n■■ The Central Government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, \nwhich aims to promote investment, innovation and \nskill development across Indian manufacturing sectors, \nnames renewable energy technologies as one of its key \nfocus sectors.\n\n■■ In the 2016/17 budget, the Central Government \nremoved all excise duty on small-scale solar systems, \nas well as on a number of raw materials necessary for \nthe development of solar and wind projects.\n\n■■ A number of State Governments have also introduced \npolicies to encourage renewable investment through \ntax relief and other measures. Recent examples \ninclude the Tamil Nadu Incentive for Domestic Solar \nRooftops and the Maharashtra Renewable Energy \nPolicy 2015.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ In 2016, Indian company Adani Group opened the \n650MW solar plant in Kamuthi, Tamil Nadu. When \nrunning at full capacity, the plant will be able to power \n150,000 homes.\n\n■■ Tamil Nadu is also the home of India’s largest wind \npower generator, the Muppandal windfarm with a \ntotal capacity of 1,500MW.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 37\n\n■■ One of India’s largest companies, energy giant Tata, \nhas announced its intention to source 30 to 40% of its \nenergy from renewable sources by 2025.\n\n■■ Japanese company Softbank has recently joined with \nTaiwan’s Foxconn and Indian corporate group Bharti \nenterprises to commit a joint US$20 billion to invest \nin solar power in India.\n\n■■ French company EDF announced its intention to invest \nUS$2 billion in renewable wind and solar projects in \nIndia in September 2016.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ India’s foreign direct investment regulatory scheme \nhas been substantially liberalised in recent years. \n\n■■ There are two routes for investment in India:\n\n – the ‘automatic route’ where up to 100% foreign \nownership is permissible in certain sectors; or\n\n – the ‘government route’ which requires prior \ngovernment approval for sectors not mentioned in \nthe ‘automatic route’ or for investments in certain \nsectors beyond the permissible limits (e.g. banking, \ndefence, strategic industries and agriculture).\n\n■■ Joint ventures with local companies are a common \nway for foreign investors to enter the Indian market.\n\n■■ Investment in both electricity infrastructure and \nrenewable energy is actively encouraged by the Indian \nGovernment. \n\n■■ The MNRE is playing a proactive role in promoting \ninbound renewable energy foreign direct investment \nby offering a number of incentives such as generation-\nbased incentives, capital and interest subsidies, viability \ngap funding, concessional finance and fiscal incentives.\n\n■■ According to the Department of Industrial Policy and \nPromotion, foreign direct investment inflows from \nnon-conventional energy sources during 2016 was \nworth US$4.77 billion.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ India ratified the Paris Agreement on 2 October 2016, \nafter receiving Cabinet approval in September. The \ndeclaration made at ratification commits to “following \nthe low carbon path to progress” while “keeping in \nview… the eradication of poverty and provision of \nbasic needs for all its citizens”. \n\n■■ India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, \nreleased in September 2015, set a number of targets \nincluding lowering emissions intensity of its GDP by \n33% below 2005 levels by 2030. India also signalled \nits intention to “follow a path cleaner than the one \nfollowed by many countries in the past”, by embracing \ninnovative technologies, engaging actively and \ncreatively in multilateral negotiations, and promoting \nGandhian principles of sustainable living.\n\n\n\n38 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Central Electricity Authority –

world’s largest Muslim \npopulation. Its 17,000 islands foster a diverse range of cultures, languages and ethnicities, which inspired the \ncountry’s motto of “unity in diversity”. Indonesia was once a Dutch colony and declared its independence \nshortly after Japanese occupation ended in 1945. After a long period of political instability, Indonesia held \nlegislative elections in 1999 and is now regarded as the third largest democracy in the world. Important issues \nwithin Indonesia include combating poverty and domestic terrorism, the implementation of reforms and the \npromotion of transparency in its governmental institutions. \n\nINDONESIA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 39\n\n\n\n40 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Total installed capacity in 2015 was 55.5GW. \nOf this amount, coal accounted for 56%, gas \naccounted for 24.9%, oil accounted for 8.6% and \nrenewables accounted for 10.5%.\n\n■■ Indonesia has a national electrification rate of 88.3%. \nThe highest electrification rates are within the \nJava-Bali system, with a near 100% electrification \nrate in the capital and largest city, Jakarta. Rural \nelectrification poses a challenge, with the outer ring of \nislands having a significantly lower electrification rate. \n\n■■ In 2015, the average cost of electricity was US$0.097 \nper kWh.\n\n■■ It is predicted that electricity demand will grow to \n8.5% per year to 2025.\n\n■■ In 2014, in order to cater for increased demand and \nto improve Indonesia’s electricity infrastructure, \nGovernment Regulation No. 79/2014 revised the 2006 \nNational Energy Plan and adopted a new (2014) plan. \nThe 2014 plan aims to re-establish Indonesia’s energy \nindependence by reducing the export of energy \nresources and re-directing this to the domestic \nmarket. The plan also seeks to rebalance the energy \nmix, such that there is more of a focus on renewable \nenergy. \n\n■■ A number of other electricity plans have also been \nreleased in recent years, including:\n\n – in January 2015, the Government announced the \n‘35GW Programme’ which plans to develop 35GW \nof additional power capacity by 2018, and a further \n45GW by 2025; and \n\n – in June 2016, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources issued the 2016-2025 Electricity \nSupply Business Plan which is a 10-year electricity \ndevelopment plan for the operating areas of \nPerusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia’s \nmajor electricity generator and supplier. This \nplan aims to achieve a 99.7% electrification ratio \nfor Indonesia by 2025. \n\nGovernment\n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \noversees electricity regulation, as well as the creation \nand implementation of Indonesia’s energy policy which \nincludes a National Electricity Plan. The Directorate-\nGeneral of Electricity within the Ministry of Energy \nand Mineral Resources assists with the implementation \nof this plan.\n\n■■ The Ministry of Finance approves Government-\noffered tax incentives for a power project and \nany Government guarantees. The Ministry also \nrecommends the maximum electricity subsidy in the \nnational budget which may be allocated to PLN.\n\n■■ As PLN is a state-owned enterprise, the Ministry \nof State-Owned Enterprises supervises PLN’s \nmanagement. \n\n■■ The National Energy Council is engaged in dealing \nwith any future energy crisis, among other roles. \n\nElectricity laws \n\n■■ Electricity Law No. 30/2009 is the key piece of \nlegislation regulating the electricity sector. Under \nLaw No. 30/2009, the Government has the authority \nto issue licenses and determine electricity tariffs. \nElectricity supply is controlled by the State but \nconducted by the Central and Regional Governments. \nPLN occupies this role as the main electricity supplier, \nhaving priority rights over supply. Law No. 30/2009 also \nprovides for competition in the supply and distribution \nof electricity, and establishes the basic framework for \nprivate entities to participate in the sector. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources’ \nRegulation No. 1/2015 allows power plant developers \nto cooperate directly with other power plant \ndevelopers in supplying electricity, without the need \nfor a new power supply license.\n\n■■ Electricity Law No. 20/2002 sought to further privatise \nthe industry by allowing market-driven tariffs and \nindependent regulation while also amending Law \nNo. 15/1985. However, Law No. 20/2002 was ruled \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 41\n\nas unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court \nbecause electricity is a strategic commodity that the \nIndonesian Government must control. \n\n■■ Energy Law No. 30/2007 outlines the management of \nenergy resources and the Government’s goals for the \nfuture development of energy mix. Law No. 30/2007 \nemphasised energy security as an important issue and, \nas a consequence, established the National Energy \nCouncil to deal with this issue. \n\nGeneration \n\n■■ PLN (including its subsidiaries Pembangkitan Jawa \nBali and Indonesia Power) owns most of the power-\ngeneration, transmission and distribution assets.  \nAt the end of 2015, PLN and its subsidiaries \naccounted for 70% of the total installed capacity of \npower plants, which amounted to 38.3GW of the \n55.5GW. \n\n■■ Independent power producers and various electricity \ncooperatives also generate electricity, however PLN \nis the sole buyer of electricity and retains the right of \nfirst refusal. \n\nDistribution and transmission\n\n■■ PLN is the only business entity involved in electrical \ndistribution and transmission. In 2015, Indonesia’s \ntransmission network consisted of around 42,000km \nof transmission lines. With over 17,000 islands, the \nmajority of the electricity networks in Indonesia \nare isolated. Only the transmission networks on \nthe islands of Java, Madura, Bali and Sumatra are \nconnected. However, transmission line bottlenecks \npresent as a frequent issue on these islands. \n\n■■ While electricity laws allow for private participation in \npower supply and access to transmission and distribution, \nindependent power producer participation is limited \nto generation. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources’ Regulation No. 1/2015 aims to change this \nlimited participation by allowing joint use of the networks \nwithout the need for a new power supply licence. \n\n■■ Indonesia’s main priorities for its distribution network \nare to increase the electrification rate, improve \nsystem reliability and accommodate demand growth. \n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Despite an abundance of renewable energy resources, \nrenewable energy currently plays a minor role in \nIndonesia’s energy supply. However, the Government \nis seeking an increase in renewables generation to 23% \nof total energy consumption by 2025 and 31% by 2050. \n\n■■ Historical fuel subsidies, low electricity tariffs, \ncomplex regulations, legal uncertainties, logistical \nchallenges and extensive cheap coal resources have \ndeterred potential renewables investors. Despite \nthe reduction of fuel subsidies and efforts by the \nGovernment to streamline regulatory processes and \notherwise incentivise investment, these issues still \nremain significant barriers to the development of the \nrenewables sector.\n\n■■ The Directorate General of Renewable Energy and \nEnergy Conservation, which sits under the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources, is the chief regulator in \nthe renewable energy area. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Indonesia has a significant hydropower potential \nof up to 75GW, mostly centred in the eastern \nprovinces. According to the Ministry of Energy and \nMineral Resources, in 2015 Indonesia had an installed \nhydropower capacity of about 5,332MW, making it the \nmost utilised source of renewable energy at present. \n\n■■ The Government’s aim to develop industrial \nzones in Papua and other rural areas under the \n2011 Masterplan for Acceleration and Expansion \nof Indonesia’s Economic Development could help \nincrease the exploitation of medium and large-scale \nhydropower resources. PLN’s Electricity Supply \nBusiness Plan (2016-2025), sets a target to install an \nadditional 1,500MW of hydropower capacity by 2025. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ In 2015, installed wind power capacity was 3.6MW, \nof which 1.84MW was off-grid and mainly for rural \npower supply. The estimated potential of wind energy \nin Indonesia is generally regarded to be small as wind \nvelocity in Indonesia is relatively low.\n\n\n\n■■ Wind speeds averaging between 3m/s and 6m/s have \nencouraged government investment in small and \nmedium sized wind projects, however large-scale \nwind farms are not feasible with such wind speeds. \nMuch like in Mongolia and China, Indonesia’s most \nproductive wind sites are located far from population \ncentres, thus requiring extensive transmission \ninfrastructure. \n\n■■ PLN’s Electricity Supply Business Plan (2016 – 2025), \nsets a target to install an additional 640MW of \nwind capacity by 2025. In September 2016, a power \npurchase agreement was signed between PLN and \na consortium of investors led by Singaporean-based \ninvestment fund Equis to develop a 60MW wind farm \nin Tolo, South Sulawesi. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Indonesia has an installed capacity of about 80MW. \nThe use of off-grid solar photovoltaic systems to \nharness Indonesia’s considerable solar resources offer \nsignificant potential to provide electrification and \nreplace costly diesel-fired generation in remote areas. \n\n■■ In February 2016, the Government announced a target \nfor installed solar capacity of 5,000MW by 2020. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Indonesia has great geothermal potential of over \n28,000MW which is estimated to be 40% of total \nglobal resources. \n\n■■ Despite this massive potential and the fact that the \nbulk of the county’s geothermal resources are located \nnear demand areas, the development of Indonesia’s \ngeothermal sector has been slow with only 1,438MW \nof capacity currently installed. \n\n■■ PLN’s Electricity Supply Business Plan (2016 – 2025), \nsets a target to install an additional 6,150MW of \ngeothermal capacity by 2025. \n\n■■ There is a separate legal regime for geothermal \nenergy production in Indonesia compared to other \nforms of electricity. In 2014, the Government passed \nGeothermal Law No. 21/2014 which replaced the \nregulatory regime under Geothermal Law No. 27/2003. \nThe new law is designed to expedite the utilisation of \ngeothermal resources and centralises the permit and \ntender process for geothermal working areas. It also \nintroduces a mandatory production bonus payable to \nthe local government in which the geothermal field is \nlocated.\n\n42 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 43\n\n■■ The 2014 Geothermal Law also marked a change \nfrom the previous regulatory regime as geothermal \nactivities are no longer classified as mining activities. \nThe law specifically allows geothermal activities to \nbe undertaken in protected and conservation forest \nareas, where an estimated 42% of resources are found.\n\n■■ In order to overcome barriers to investment and \ndevelopment of new geothermal sites, in early 2016 \nthe Director for Geothermal Energy indicated that \nthe Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources would \nintroduce a new regulation designed to reduce \nexploration risk for potential investors. To date no \nsuch regulation has been introduced. \n\n■■ In December 2016, President Joko Widodo \ninaugurated new geothermal units at Lahendong and \nUlubelu, adding a total of 95MW to the capacity of \nthese plants. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Indonesia has an estimated potential power generation \nfrom bioenergy of 33,000MW from biomass and \n17,000MW from biogas. \n\n■■ Most of the 1,800MW of current installed capacity \nof bioenergy is off-grid. This reflects the fact that \nbioenergy, especially from biomass such as wood fuel \nand rice husks, has traditionally been an important \nsource of energy for households and small industry in \nrural areas. \n\n■■ The Government has plans to grow biogas and \nbiomass plants, including waste-to-power plants, and \nhas already implemented incentives for electricity \nproduction generated from bioenergy.\n\n■■ In 2015, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \nset a target of 2,872MW of total installed bioenergy \ncapacity by 2019.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ With 54,716km of coastline, Indonesia has vast \npotential for ocean current, wave and tidal energy.\n\n■■ In 2014, the Directorate General of Renewable Energy \nand Energy Conservation estimated that the ‘practical’ \npotential of ocean energy in Indonesia is 49GW. \nDespite this, Indonesia currently has no installed \nocean energy capacity. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has two \npilot projects underway, one at Nusa Penida and one \nin Nusa Tenggara, with a plan to have 1MW of ocean \nplant capacity ready by 2019. \n\n■■ In April 2016, SBS International Ltd and Atlantis \nResources Ltd announced a joint venture to develop \na 150MW tidal stream site under a 25-year power \npurchase agreement with PLN. SBS International also \nsigned a memorandum of understanding with PLN in \nAugust 2015 to develop ocean energy at several sites. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Budget cuts in late 2016 by the Ministry of Energy \nand Mineral Resources of some Rp900 billon (approx. \nUS$67.6 million) saw the Directorate General for \nRenewable Energy and Energy Conservation’s budget \nfall from Rp2.3 trillion (approx. US$172.6 million) to \nRp1.7 trillion (approx. US$127.6 million). As a result \nsome of the Ministry’s renewable energy projects will \nbe postponed including the installation of solar panels \nat airports in Bali, Medan, North Sumatra, Makassar \nand South Sulawesi, as well as the construction of a \nnew micro-hydropower plant in Papua. \n\n■■ The Indonesian Government’s reduction in fossil \nfuel subsidies (notably the abolition of subsidies \nfor gasoline in 2015), is generally regarded by \ncommentators as a positive step in providing \nincentives for energy efficiency and increased \ninvestment in the renewable energy industry. \nMoreover, it has been estimated by Toft and Lontoh \nthat reforming all of Indonesia’s fossil fuel subsidies \ncould reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions \nby 7 to 12%. However, proposals to reduce electricity \nsubsidies, which cost the Government Rp58 trillion \n(approx. US$4.35 billion) in 2016, have proved to be \npolitically unpopular, with reform postponed once by \nPresident Widodo and once by Parliament in 2016. \nReform is expected in 2017. \n\n■■ The slowing of commodities markets in recent \nyears has led PLN to express concerns that the \ncomparatively higher costs of purchasing renewable \nelectricity would hinder it from operating at a \ncompetitive level.\n\n\n\n44 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Decision \nNo. 2/2004 created the Green Energy Policy 2004, \nwhich aims to reduce the country’s reliance on oil. \n\n■■ Energy Law No. 30/2007 is the framework policy \nwhich sets out the Government’s basic targets for the \nfuture development of energy supplies, gives regional \ngovernments the power to develop master plans \nand regulations on energy and includes incentives \nfor private and state companies involved in the \ndistribution and development of renewable energies. \n\n■■ Government Regulation No. 70/2009 on Energy \nConservation forms the National Energy Conservation \nPlan, promotes energy efficiency and offers incentives \nfor the importation of energy-saving devices. \n\n■■ Geothermal Law No. 21/2014 regulates geothermal \nenergy production and development in Indonesia.  \nThis law is discussed in more detail above. \n\n■■ Government Regulation No. 79/2014 on National Energy \nPolicy sets out the definition of renewable energy and \nsets out the Government’s target for 23% of energy \nproduction to come from renewable resources by 2025. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Indonesia currently offers tax concessions for \nrenewable energy projects, particularly geothermal \nenergy projects. Incentives for geothermal projects \ninclude an investment credit of 20% of the qualifying \ncapital investment, an extended tax loss carry forward \nperiod for up to 10 years, accelerated depreciation \nrates and a maximum dividend withholding tax of 10%.\n\n■■ The Ministry of Finance’s Regulation No. 21/PMK. \n011/2010 provides similar tax and also customs \nincentives for other renewable energy technologies.\n\n■■ Importantly, since 2002, the Ministry of Energy and \nMineral Resources has also established a feed-in tariff \nscheme for renewable energy. However, international \ndevelopers have not been as attracted by the feed-in \ntariff given the fixed end-user energy prices, which are \nregarded by many as unsustainably low. \n\n■■ Ministerial Regulation No 04/2012 on Electricity Purchase \nfrom Small and Medium Scale Renewable Energy and \nExcess Power introduces new differentiated feed-in \ntariff levels in Indonesia to incentivise the production \nof electricity from biomass, biogas, municipal waste \nand hydropower plants below generation capacity \nof 10MW. It also obliges PLN to purchase electricity \ngenerated from renewable energy installations.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ Foreign governments, international organisations and \nprivate investors are all key players in financing and \nsupporting the development of renewables projects \nin Indonesia. One primary source of funding for \nrenewable energy, particularly for the geothermal \nsector, has come from the US$400 million Clean \nEnergy Fund, co-financed by the Asian Development \nBank and the World Bank. \n\n■■ In April 2016, the Energy and Mineral Resources \nMinistry announced that Indonesia had attracted \nUS$327 million in renewable energy investments \nduring the first quarter of 2016, with US$250 million \ngoing to bioenergy and US$75 million to geothermal \npower. The Ministry suggested that this sharp increase \nin investments was a reflection of the incentive \nprovided by the national ‘single-window’ approval \nsystem for renewable energy projects and indicated \nthat the Government would seek to further cut red \ntape for investors.\n\n■■ The 330MW Sarulla geothermal project in North \nSumatra is currently being developed by a consortium \nof investors from Indonesia, Japan and the US. It is \nexpected to be completed by 2018/2019. \n\n■■ A number of geothermal plants have recently become \noperational, including Ulubelu (55MW), Lahendong \n(40MW) and Karaha Bodas (30MW). \n\n■■ Cisokan hydropower plant has a capacity of 1GW. The \nproject is substantially funded by the World Bank.\n\n■■ As part of Indonesia’s Power Transmission \nDevelopment Phase II, PLN is undertaking extensive \nrepairs to the transmission infrastructure on grids \nin Java-Bali, Sulawesi and Kalimantan. This project is \nfunded by the World Bank. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 45\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Investment Law No. 25/2007 requires foreign investors \nin the electricity sector to obtain a foreign investment \nlicense from the Capital Investment Coordinating \nBoard (BKPM). In order to obtain the foreign \ninvestment license, an Indonesian company must be \nestablished under the Investment Law. The Indonesian \ncompany can then apply to the Minister of Energy \nand Mineral Resources for a licence to engage in the \nenergy sector. \n\n■■ BKPM provides a one-stop integrated service to \nhandle the investment application process. Like the \nPhilippines, Indonesia has a ‘negative list’ for foreign \ninvestment. It is set out in Presidential Regulation  \nNo. 44/2016. This list sets prohibitions and limits on \nforeign ownership in the production, transmission \nand distribution of electricity of up to 95%. However, \nforeign ownership of power plants over 10MW is \nallowed through partnerships or cooperatives and \n100% foreign ownership is allowed in the biomass \npellet industry. Geothermal facility services may have \nforeign ownership of up to 90%. \n\n■■ Industry analysts have recognised an increase in \nforeign investment as crucial to growing renewable \nenergy development in Indonesia. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Indonesia ratified the Paris Agreement on  \n31 October 2016 and in its Intended Nationally \nDetermined Contribution committed the country \nto reduce its emissions by 26% (relative to a \nbusiness as usual baseline) by 2020 and by 29% by \n2030. Indonesia also set a “conditional reduction \ntarget” of up to 41% reduction in emissions by 2030, \nsubject to availability of international support for \nfinance, technology transfer and development and \ncapacity building. \n\n\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Perusahaan Listrik Negara – www.pln.co.id \n\n■■ Pembangkit Jawa-Bali – www.ptpjb.com \n\n■■ Indonesia Power – www.indonesiapower.co.id \n\n■■ Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources – www.esdm.go.id \n\n■■ Directorate General of Electrification – http://www.djk.esdm.go.id/ \n\n■■ Directorate General of Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation – http://www.ebtke.esdm.go.id/home \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ International Energy Agency, Indonesia 2015, accessed at: https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/\npublication/Indonesia_IDR.pdf\n\n■■ PricewaterhouseCoopers, Power in Indonesia Investment and Taxation Guide, accessed at: https://www.pwc.com/id/en/\nenergy-utilities-mining/assets/power/power-guide-2016.pdf\n\n■■ PricewaterhouseCoopers, Indonesia Energy, Utilities & Mining NewsFlash, accessed at: https://www.pwc.com/id/en/\npublications/assets/eumpublications/newsflash/2016/pwc-indonesia-eum-newsflash-2016-59.pdf\n\n■■ Reegle, Energy Profile Indonesia, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/indonesia-energy-profile/ID\n\n■■ Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Laporan Kinerja Kemerterian ESDM 2015, accessed at: http://www2.esdm.\ngo.id/publikasi/lakip-kementerian-esdm.html \n\n■■ Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, 2016 Handbook of Energy & Economic Statistics of Indonesia, accessed at: \nhttp://www.esdm.go.id/assets/admin/file/pub/Handbook_of_Energy_Economic_Statistics_of_Indonesia_2016.pdf/\n\n■■ Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, Energy Outlook 2016: Energy Development in Supporting the \nGreen Industry, accessed at: http://www.bppt.go.id/outlook-energi/bppt-outlook-energi-indonesia-2016 \n\n■■ United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, First Nationally Determined Contribution Indonesia, \naccessed at: http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/Pages/Party.aspx?party=IDN///\n\n46 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttp://www.pln.co.id\nhttp://www.ptpjb.com\nhttp://www.indonesiapower.co.id\nhttp://www.esdm.go.id\nhttp://www.djk.esdm.go.id/\nhttp://www.ebtke.esdm.go.id/home\nhttps://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Indonesia_IDR.pdf\nhttps://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Indonesia_IDR.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.com/id/en/energy-utilities-mining/assets/power/power-guide-2016.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.com/id/en/energy-utilities-mining/assets/power/power-guide-2016.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.com/id/en/publications/assets/eumpublications/newsflash/2016/pwc-indonesia-eum-newsflash-2016-59.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.com/id/en/publications/assets/eumpublications/newsflash/2016/pwc-indonesia-eum-newsflash-2016-59.pdf\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/indonesia-energy-profile/ID\nhttp://www2.esdm.go.id/publikasi/lakip-kementerian-esdm.html\nhttp://www2.esdm.go.id/publikasi/lakip-kementerian-esdm.html\nhttp://www.esdm.go.id/assets/admin/file/pub/Handbook_of_Energy_Economic_Statistics_of_Indonesia_2016.pdf\nhttp://www.bppt.go.id/outlook-energi/bppt-outlook-energi-indonesia-2016\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/Pages/Party.aspx?party=IDN\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Civil Law\n\nLanguage: Japanese \n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 34 of 190 (down 2 rankings)\n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 8 of 138 (down 2 rankings)\n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 40 of 180 (down 18 rankings)\n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 20 of 176 (down 2 rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 20 of 188 (down 3 rankings)\n\nPopulation: 126.9 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$38,840\n\nPROFILE\n\nFollowing World War Two, Japan adopted western parliamentary democracy. On the back of strong \ngovernment-industry cooperation, technological advancements and labour force growth, Japan’s post-war \neconomy became one of the most advanced in the world. Despite an economic slowdown in the 1990s, Japan \nis currently the third largest economy in the world behind the US and China. The disasters of 2011 triggered \nby Japan’s largest-ever earthquake tested the country’s institutions whilst thrusting energy issues into the \nnational and global spotlight. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s re-election to office in December 2012 saw Japan \ncontinue its ambitious economic and security reforms.\n\nJAPAN\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 47\n\n\n\n48 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ According to the Federation of Electric Power \nCompanies of Japan, in 2015 Japan generated \nelectricity from oil (9%), coal (31%), natural gas (44%), \nnuclear (1.1%), hydropower (9.6%) and  \nnon-hydropower renewables (4.7%).\n\n■■ Japan’s energy self-sufficiency rate is a mere 7.7%.  \nThis is substantially lower than other major developed \ncountries, however total energy consumed by end \nusers decreased for the seventh consecutive year in \n2016 largely due to increased efforts aimed at energy \nefficiency and slowing economic growth. \n\n■■ Japan has the second highest cost of electricity \nin Asia. In 2015, the retail rate of electricity was \nUS$0.28 per kWh. \n\n■■ In the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s \n(METI) 2016 Annual Report on Energy, the \nGovernment outlined the long term energy supply and \ndemand outlook for 2030. The Government proposes \nthat by 2030 nuclear power will account for 20 to 22% \nof supply, thermal power for 56%, LNG for 27%, crude \nfor 26%, oil for 3% and renewable energy for 22 to \n24% of the total energy mix. The Government justifies \nthis energy mix on the basis of securing Japan the \nso-called ‘3E+S’; energy security, economic efficiency, \nenvironmental protection and safety.\n\n■■ Japan continues to liberalise and deregulate all aspects \nof its electricity sector, most recently the retail sector.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Basic Act on Energy Policy was enacted in  \nJune 2002. This Act sets out the principles regarding \nenergy policy, energy security, adaptability to the \nenvironment and the utilisation of market mechanisms. \n\n■■ The Electricity Utilities Law (amended significantly in \n1995) aims to protect the benefits to consumers \nof electricity, to manage the development of \nthe electricity utility supply business, to secure \npublic safety and to contribute to environmental \npreservation by regulating the installation, \nconstruction and operation of electrical facilities. \n\n■■ The Electricity and Gas Market Surveillance \nCommission was established in September 2015 to \nensure that electricity companies comply with the \nElectricity Utilities Law. The Commission monitors \nissues related to consumer protection, market power, \nthe neutrality of network operators and it can also \nrecommend changes to the market rules.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ The electricity producers in Japan are strictly \nregulated by METI. Before the liberalisation of the \nelectricity retail sector in 2016, electric power \nbusinesses in Japan were classified as either General \nElectric Utilities, Wholesale Electric Utilities, \nIndependent Power Producers, Power Producers and \nSuppliers or Specified Electric Utilities. \n\n■■ The General Electric Utilities are responsible for \nsupplying electricity, from power generation to \ndistribution, to the consumers in their respective \nservice area. There are 10 General Electric Utilities \nin Japan, namely, Hokkaido Electric Power Company, \nTohoku Electric Power Company, Tokyo Electric \nPower Company, Chubu Electric Power Company, \nHokuriku Electric Power Company, Kansai Electric \nPower Company, Chugoku Electric Power Company, \nShikoku Electric Power Company, Kyushu Electric \nPower Company and Okinawa Electric Power \nCompany. In the past, the electric power business \nin Japan was dominated by General Electric Utilities, \nwhich had monopoly control in their respective areas. \n\n■■ As part of the deregulation of the electricity \nsector, 280 electricity retailers were registered in \nApril 2016 and approximately 530,000 applications for \nswitching power suppliers were filed. By March 2016, \napproximately 80% of consumers were considering \nchanging power suppliers. This deregulation is set \nto intensify competition between power retailers. \nBy 2020, the whole market is set to open up, with \nregional power companies losing monopoly on \ninfrastructure. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 49\n\n■■ The Organisation for Cross-regional Coordination of \nTransmission Operators was established in April 2015 \nwith the purpose of strengthening the capacity to \ntransmit electricity beyond each of the service areas \nof the ten general transmission utilities. \n\n■■ Currently 1,200MW of electricity can be transmitted \nbetween Japan’s western and eastern regions. \nHowever, the difference in frequency (60Hz in the \nwest as opposed to 50Hz in the east), makes east-\nwest power transmission relatively difficult.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Prior to the Fukushima nuclear accident, nuclear \npower plants generated approximately 30% of Japan’s \nenergy. Since the accident, almost all of Japan’s nuclear \npower stations have been switched off, and there have \nbeen unprecedented renewable energy opportunities \nin Japan. Some nuclear plants were shut down as a \nresult of residents seeking injunctions in local courts.\n\n■■ There was initial uncertainty in the renewables \nindustry following the re-election of the pro-nuclear \nLiberal Democratic Party in 2012. However, Japan \ncontinues to be one of the most promising renewables \nmarkets in the Asia-Pacific.\n\n■■ Japan has one of the most generous feed-in tariff \nschemes in the world. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower is the largest renewable energy \ncontributor to Japan’s overall electricity supply. \n\n■■ About two-thirds of Japan’s estimated hydropower \nreserves have already been developed.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Hilly and mountainous terrain has presented \nchallenges to wind energy development. However, \nHokkaido and Tohoku are two of the regions where \nlarge-scale wind farms continue to be constructed. \nWithin these two prefectures, the Japanese \nGovernment has also committed to the construction \nof a high voltage transmission network to help wind \nproducers gain grid access.\n\n■■ Offshore wind continues to be a promising area for \nmany investors. The 2016/17 financial year is expected \nto be a record year for offshore wind investment in \nJapan fuelled by feed-in tariffs and relaxed rules on \ndeveloping offshore wind farms in harbours and ports. \nAccording to the Japan Wind Power Association, from \nMarch 2016 to March 2017, approximately 300MW of \nwind capacity was added, up from around 157MW for \nthe same time the previous year. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Japan ranked first on the International Trade \nAdministration list of top solar export markets in \n2016. Japan is a leading producer of photovoltaic \npanels and regarded as a global pioneer in the \nresidential solar market. Approximately 45% of \nphotovoltaic cells in the world are manufactured in \nJapan (although Japan faces increasing competition \nfrom Chinese manufacturers).\n\n■■ On 22 February 2016, METI’s feed-in tariff pricing \ncommittee proposed to reduce rates by 11.15% \nfor above 10kW solar usage, which was a sign of \ntightening government budgets and a period of \nreduced incentives.\n\n■■ To promote the use of photovoltaic cells in \nhouseholds, the Government offers installation cost \nsubsidies. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ The potential for geothermal power is significant, but \nstrict regulations have kept geothermal power from \ngrowing quickly. For example, nearly 80% of Japan’s \ngeothermal resources are located within national \nparks or protected hot springs, which are designated \nrestricted zones with limits on the type and location \nof work that can be done.\n\n■■ METI is considering 36 additional geothermal projects \nin addition to the 537MW of capacity at the 17 \nfacilities that currently exist. Japan aims to increase \ngeothermal capacity by another 50MW by 2020.\n\n\n\n50 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ Japanese petroleum company Idemitsu Kosan began \nconstruction of a 5MW geothermal power plant in \nJapan’s south-western prefecture of Oita. The project \nwill be one of the largest binary power plants in Japan.\n\n■■ In June 2016, the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National \nCorporation (an organisation under the jurisdiction \nof METI), established an Advisory Committee for \nGeothermal Resources Development, aiming to \nsupport regional municipalities in playing increasing \nroles as coordinators for appropriate management of \ngeothermal resources. Many regional municipalities \nare facing challenges regarding this issue, including a \nlack of accumulated expertise on the development of \ngeothermal resources and a shortage of networks to \nfind appropriate experts.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Japan has the fifth largest biomass market in the \nworld.\n\n■■ In November 2015, 85MW worth of biomass capacity \nwas commissioned, the largest amount since the feed-\nin tariff regime was launched.\n\n■■ The Government sees biomass energy as a key \nrenewables source, and has introduced a range of \nsupport measures such as start-up grants to biomass-\npower producers, and policies to assist in raw material \nprocurement to boost the domestic biomass-power \nmarket.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ In late 2014, Japan’s New Energy and Industrial \nTechnology Development Organisation selected two \nmajor industrial corporations, IHI Corp and Toshiba \nCorp, to start field testing ocean energy generation in \nthe near future in the form of a turbine system driven \nby the ocean current.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Nuclear energy remains unpopular amongst the \nJapanese public, with support for renewable energy \noptions continuing to rise despite the likelihood of \nelectricity price rises if renewable energy options are \ndeveloped more rapidly. \n\n■■ In 2015, the Government published a “Long-term \nEnergy Supply and Demand Outlook” to present the \nideal structure of energy supply and demand for 2030. \nEnergy efficiency and renewable energy was said to \nplay a key role in achieving this objective.\n\n■■ The Government has been undertaking substantial \nreforms of the electricity sector and also the specific \nlegislation governing renewable energy.\n\n■■ Complex environmental impact assessments and \nzoning restrictions continue to be significant barriers \nto guaranteeing power markets for investors.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Act on Special Measures Concerning Procurement of \nRenewable Energy-Sourced Electricity by Electric Utilities \npromotes the use of renewable energy sources for \nelectricity, recognising that renewable energy is a \n“stable and appropriate” source of energy for the \neconomic and social environment in Japan and abroad. \nThe Act was amended on 3 June 2016, to reflect \nthe Government’s revised 2030 goal of having 22 to \n24% contribution from renewable energy sources \nto overall capacity. The 2016 amendments also \nintroduced a new certification system for feed-in tariff \neligibility and introduced a tender bid system for feed-\nin tariffs, initially for large-scale solar projects. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The Act on Purchase of Renewable Energy Sourced \nElectricity by Electric Utilities established a feed-in \ntariff regime in 2012, by requiring electric utilities to \n\n\n\npurchase electricity generated from renewable energy \nsources based on a fixed-period contract with fixed \nprice. The tariffs are the Government’s chief incentive \nfor renewables investment and consumption. As \ndiscussed above, the regime was amended in 2016. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Government has committed to constructing \na major renewable energy base in the Fukushima \nPrefecture. Generous national government subsidies \nhave been implemented to assist the prefecture’s goal \nin becoming 100% energy self-sufficient by 2040. \n\n■■ Toshiba Corp., Tohoku Electric Power Co. and Iwatani \nCorp. have announced a study into a joint hydrogen \nmanufacturing facility in Fukushima Prefecture. \nThe three power companies aim to produce large \nquantities of hydrogen that can drive a total of 10,000 \nfuel cell vehicles. The hydrogen will be transported to \nTokyo, providing a power source for fuel cell vehicles \nto be used around the venues of the 2020 Tokyo \nOlympic Games. This facility is set to have the world’s \nlargest hydrogen production capacity. \n\n■■ In January 2015, Kyocera TCL Solar and joint-\nventure partner Century Tokyo Leasing Corp. \nbegan construction on what they claim will be the \nworld’s largest floating solar power plant. The plant \nis in Chiba, 75km east of Tokyo. Planned to open in \nMarch 2018, the 13.7MW power station will generate \n\nenough electricity to power approximately 4,970 \nhouseholds. Three water based installations are \nalready in operation near the city of Kobe.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Government’s plans to cut the corporate tax rate \nbelow 30% and efforts to create a ‘one-stop shop’ \nfor foreign investors looking to establish a company \nin Japan, are underpinning some of the Government’s \nefforts to increase foreign direct investment. \n\n■■ If a foreign company is wishing to obtain a share of a \nnon-listed company, or a share of more than 10% of \na listed company operating in the Japanese electricity \nmarket, the company must first submit a report to the \nMinister of Finance and the METI. \n\n■■ There are no specific restrictions on foreign \ninvestment in the feed-in tariff regime. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Japan signed the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016 \nand ratified on 8 November 2016.\n\n■■ Japan aims to achieve a reduction of 26% in \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2030. \n\nwww.dlapiper.com |

federated in 1963. The early years of the country were marred by a number of internal conflicts, \nterritorial claims from neighbouring countries and Singapore’s secession from the federation in 1965. \nPresently, Malaysia comprises 13 states and three federal territories. Former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir \nbin Mohammad (1981 – 2003) is largely credited with transforming Malaysia’s economy. The pro-business \npolicies of successive governments have ensured that manufacturing, services and tourism are Malaysia’s \ndominant industry sectors. In recent years, the country has faced a corruption scandal involving the national \nsovereign wealth fund, 1MBD. \n\nMALAYSIA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 53\n\n\n\n54 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Malaysia’s total installed electricity capacity is \napproximately 30GW (not including private \ngeneration). Of this amount, gas and coal-sourced \nelectricity contributed over 90% of capacity.\n\n■■ Malaysia has nearly achieved 100% electrification. \nThis is a significant recent increase considering \nelectrification was only 80% in 1990.\n\n■■ Key government bodies in the energy sector \ninclude the:\n\n – Energy Section of the Economic Planning Unit of \nthe Prime Minister’s Department;\n\n – Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water \nwhich facilitates and regulates the energy sector; \nand\n\n – Energy Commission, which was established under \nthe Energy Commission Act 2001 to also regulate \nthe energy sector with a particular focus on the \nelectricity supply and piped gas supply industries in \nPeninsula Malaysia and Sabah.\n\n■■ The Sustainable Energy Development Authority \n(SEDA) is the statutory authority empowered under \nthe Sustainable Energy Development Authority Act 2011 to: \n\n – promote Malaysia’s national policy objectives for \nrenewable energy;\n\n – promote investment in the renewable energy \nsector; and \n\n – advise the Malaysian Government on sustainable \nenergy. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Supply Act 1990 (ESA) regulates a \nnumber of aspects of electricity supply, including the:\n\n – supply of electricity at reasonable prices;\n\n – licensing, registration and control of any electrical \ninstallation, plant and equipment with respect to \nmatters relating to the safety of persons; and\n\n – efficient use of electricity.\n\n■■ In 2015, the Malaysian Parliament approved a bill to \namend the ESA with the aim of enhancing governance \nin the electricity supply industry by ensuring better \nefficiency, reliability and safety. This bill received \nRoyal Assent on 30 October 2015 and commenced \noperation on 1 January 2016. \n\n■■ The Energy Commission Act 2001 is another principal \npiece of legislation. It provides for the establishment of \nthe Energy Commission. The Energy Commission has \npowers to regulate energy supply activities in Malaysia, \nand to enforce the energy supply laws.\n\n■■ Other laws regulating the electricity industry include the:\n\n – Electricity Regulations 1994;\n\n – Electricity Supply (Compounding of Offences) \nRegulations 2001; and\n\n – Licensee Supply Regulations 2008.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ Despite some privatisation, Malaysia’s electricity \nindustry is mostly vertically integrated and \nmonopolistic. The three main utility companies that \nare responsible for generation, transmission and \ndistribution of electricity are:\n\n – Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) for Peninsula \nMalaysia, a state owned enterprise that is wholly \nowned by the Malaysian Government;\n\n – Syarikat SESCO Berhad (SESCO) (formerly known \nas Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation) for \nSarawak, fully privatised in 2005; and\n\n – Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) (formerly known \nas Sabah Electricity Board) for Sabah, a mixed \nownership enterprise owned by both TNB (80%) \nand the State Government of Sabah (20%).\n\n■■ The three main utility companies are now \ncomplemented by Independent Power Producers and, \nto a lesser extent, by dedicated power producers and \nco-generators.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 55\n\n■■ In 1993, licenses were issued to Independent Power \nProducers to build, operate and own power plants.  \nIn 2015, there were 27 Independent Power Producers, \nwhich contribute approximately 43% of the total \ninstalled electricity generation capacity in Malaysia. \n\n■■ TNB also transmits and distributes electricity. SESB \nand SESCO respectively generate, transmit, and \ndistribute electricity in their respective state grids. \n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ According to SEDA, Malaysia’s total installed \nrenewables capacity is 440MW. Continued economic \ngrowth (predicted at up to 3% per year to 2030), \nis likely to ensure continuing growth in electricity \ndemand. \n\n■■ Malaysia’s target is to have 2,080MW of renewable \nenergy capacity by 2020, comprising 11% of total \nelectricity capacity nation-wide. \n\n■■ In 2010, the National Renewable Energy Policy \nand Action Plan was approved, followed by the \nintroduction of feed-in tariffs as a key stimulus for \ndevelopment of renewable energy (see below). \nThe plan provides long-term renewables goals and \nis updated every five years. The Ministry of Energy, \nGreen Technology and Water has confirmed a new \nplan will be released soon. \n\n■■ There is a renewable energy component to the \nGovernment’s general 2016 – 2020 plan. Under \nthe plan, the Government will focus on diversifying \nMalaysia’s energy mix in a more sustainable manner, \ncreating employment opportunities and skills \nenhancement. The industry is expected to create \nabout 15,300 jobs with training provided to 1,740 \npersonnel in the biomass, biogas, mini hydro and solar \nphotovoltaic energy sectors. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ TNB oversees three major hydroelectric power \ngenerating schemes including the Kenyir Sultan \nMahmud Power Station (400MW), Pergau \nHydroelectric Power Station (600MW) and the \nTemenggor Hydroelectric Power Plant (348MW). \n\n■■ Sarawak energy has two hydroelectric power stations, \neach producing 108MW and 944MW of energy \nrespectively. \n\n■■ Malaysia is also focusing on the development of small \nhydro with a goal of adding 490MW by 2020 to \nincrease renewable energy.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Onshore wind sites are limited, however they have \nexhibited potential for small and medium scale \nprojects, with average wind speeds of 4.1m/s recorded \nin the eastern peninsula region of Malaysia.\n\n■■ While the wind industry is underdeveloped at present, \nSEDA have confirmed that a wind mapping exercise \nhas recently been completed and the estimated \ncapacity for wind energy will be published in due \ncourse. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ According to SEA, Malaysia has a solar photovoltaic \ncapacity of 292MW.\n\n■■ With the support of the United Nations, Malaysia \ninitiated the Malaysian Building Integrated Photovoltaic \nproject in 2005 with the aim of promoting grid-\nconnected photovoltaic systems and developing a solar \nphotovoltaic policy framework. From 2006 to 2010, \naround 2MW of grid-connected photovoltaic systems \nwere installed. \n\n■■ Under the national renewable energy plan, Malaysia \naims to install cumulative solar photovoltaic capacity \nof 399MW by 2025 and 854MW by 2030. This aim \nlooks set to be fulfilled well ahead of time based \non the current pace of development of the solar \nphotovoltaic market.\n\n■■ According to the Ministry of Energy, Green \nTechnology and Water, feed-in tariff subscriptions for \nindividual solar photovoltaic installations are closed. \nHowever, the Government is still accepting feed-in \ntariff subscriptions for community solar photovoltaic \ninstallations. The tariff is guaranteed for 21 years \nunder the nation’s Renewable Energy Act 2010. \n\n\n\n56 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Malaysia’s first geothermal power plant in Apas Kiri is \nset to be operational by June 2018. It is expected to \nexport approximately 30MW of power to the Sabah \nelectricity grid. \n\n■■ The Government is also increasing geothermal \nexploration as part of the nation’s ‘Eleventh Plan’. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ According to SEDA, biogas has a total installed \ncapacity of approximately 34MW nation-wide, with \nbiomass capacity at approximately 88MW. \n\n■■ Some of the challenges faced by the biomass industry \nare the limited development of policy and limited \ncoordination among local agencies and biomass \nindustry, a lack of reliable and clear data on the \npotential of biomass in the market, and limited funding \nsupport. \n\n■■ Palm oil, which is more readily associated with \nenvironmental destruction, is also a major source \nof renewable energy in the country. Malaysia is the \nlargest palm oil producer in the world, with potential \nbiomass and biogas production from palm oil mill \nwaste estimated to be well over 1,000MW. \n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Ocean energy is currently not a source of renewable \nenergy in Malaysia. The viability of ocean energy \nis nonetheless being considered as part of the \nGovernment’s ‘Eleventh Plan’.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Fragmented governance and multiple agencies with \noverlapping roles, authorities, responsibilities and \njurisdictions have created complexities in governing \nthe energy sector. \n\n■■ Malaysia faces an uphill battle in meeting its renewable \nenergy target (2,080MW by 2020), considering that \ncurrent installed capacity is approximately one-\nquarter of the target amount. The country was \nwell short of the 2015 target (985MW) and, even \nif all planned renewable energy installations are \nconstructed, the 2020 target will not be achieved. \nCommentators have noted the Government’s chief \nmechanism incentivising renewable energy – the feed-\nin tariff scheme – is not sufficiently funded to meet the \nambitious target. \n\n■■ Despite these concerns, a number of large-scale \nsolar farms were announced for development in 2016 \n(see below). \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The principal piece of legislation governing renewables \nin Malaysia is the Renewable Energy Act 2011. The \nAct sets out the mechanics for a feed-in tariff for \nrenewables-sourced energy. \n\n■■ Numerous rules have been issued under the Act, \nincluding the:\n\n – Renewable Energy (Feed-in Approval and Feed-in \nTariff Rate) Rules 2011;\n\n – Renewable Energy (Technical and Operational \nRequirements) Rules 2011;\n\n – Renewable Energy (Renewable Energy Power \nPurchase Agreement) Rules 2011;\n\n – Renewable Energy (Criteria for Renewable \nResources) Regulations 2011;\n\n – Renewable Energy (Allocation from Electricity \nTariffs) Order 2011;\n\n – Renewable Energy (Recovery of Moneys by \nDistribution Licensee) Rules 2011; and\n\n – Renewable Energy (Administrative Fees) Rules 2011.\n\n■■ Guidelines have been introduced to administer the \nNet Energy Metering Scheme including the Guidelines \nof Solar Photovoltaic Installation on the Net Energy \nMetering Scheme.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 57\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The feed-in tariff is Malaysia’s main mechanism \nincentivising the generation of renewable energy \nfor facilities up to 30MW. Special approval from the \nMinister will need to be obtained for renewable \nenergy installations with an installed capacity of more \nthan 30MW. The feed-in tariff system is financed by \nelectricity consumers themselves, who contribute 1% \nof their total electricity bill towards the renewable \nenergy fund. \n\n■■ While individual solar photovoltaic installations are \nnow closed, community-based solar photovoltaic, \nbiogas and biomass are still eligible for distribution \nlicences under the scheme, with solar photovoltaic \nguaranteed for 21 years and biogas and biomass \nfor 16 years. It is hoped the long-term government \ncommitment to the scheme will give investors \nsufficient confidence. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Sabah and Sarawak Biomass Industry \nDevelopment Plan, launched in February 2016, hopes \nto leverage the rapid growth in the biomass industry, \nbuilding on an already accelerating level of interest.  \nIn 2014, 12 biomass projects worth a total RM82.9 \nbillion (approx. US$18.75 billion) had been approved.\n\n■■ In May 2016, it was announced that Edra Power \nHoldings is set to build a RM400 million (approx. \nUS$90.5 million) solar power plant in Kedah with an \nestimated capacity of 50MW. \n\n■■ In 2016, a consortium consisting of MMC \nCorporation-linked Malakoff Corporation and a DRB-\nHicom unit announced they will also build a large-scale \nsolar plant. \n\n■■ Sarawak Energy received approval to build Sarawak \nEnergy’s biggest hydroelectric project in 2016. \nThe project will produce 1,285MW of electricity. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ According to Rule 3(c)(i) of the Feed-in Tariff Rules \n2011, foreign companies must partner with a Malaysian \ncompany. This is because only 49% foreign ownership \nis permitted under Malaysian law.\n\n■■ Malaysia nonetheless has a relatively liberal foreign \ninvestment policy allowing investments across a range \nof industries. Recent legislative amendments relating \nto the regulation of companies and taxation incentives \nhave attempted to encourage business growth in \nthe face of the 1MBD scandal, which damaged the \ncountry’s investor reputation.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Malaysia signed the Paris Agreement on \n4 November 2016 and committed to reduce \nits ‘carbon intensity’ by 45% by 2030 subject to \nconditions regarding financing assistance and transfer \nof technology. \n\n■■ Malaysia also committed to maintain at least 50% of \nland areas as forest and tree cover. \n\n■■ Malaysia is yet to introduce domestic legislation \nenforcing the Paris Agreement. \n\n\n\n58 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Renewable Energy Capacity Map –

and the ‘lowest’ country in the world (average of 1.5m \nelevation above sea level). The Maldives was a British protectorate for 78 years until the country declared \nits independence in 1965. From 1978 to 2008, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was elected to six successive \npresidential terms in single-party elections. In 2008, a new constitution was introduced and multi-party \nelections were held. The Maldives’ economy is reliant on its tourism and fishing sectors, which have recovered \nsince the country’s people and infrastructure were badly affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami. The Maldives \nrecently left the Commonwealth bloc.   \n\nTHE MALDIVES\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 59\n\n\n\n60 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In 2015 (the latest reliable data), the Maldives’ total \ninstalled electricity capacity was 330MW. Almost all \nelectricity is generated from imported petroleum.\n\n■■ Each of the 186 inhabited islands of the Maldives has a \nseparate electricity powerhouse.\n\n■■ Although all the inhabited islands have had an \nelectricity supply since 2008, as at 2015, about 80 of \nthese islands had a constant electricity supply.\n\n■■ Tourist resorts both produce and consume \napproximately 60% of the Maldives’ electricity.\n\nRegulators\n\n■■ The end-cost of electricity in the Maldives is \nUS$0.27/kWh.\n\n■■ In February 2016, the Government discontinued \nelectricity subsidies and revised tariff rates. Due to \npublic complaints, the President has indicated that this \ntariff will be further revised.\n\n■■ In June 2016, the Government regulator hiked tariff \nrates for large businesses.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ Electricity generation, distribution and transmission \ninfrastructure is owned and operated by the public \nState Electric Company Ltd (STELCO), FENAKA \nCorporation Ltd (FENAKA), Malé Water and \nSewerage Company Pvt. Ltd (MWSC) and by private \nisland development committees. \n\n■■ STELCO and FENAKA are 100% owned by the \nMaldives Government, while MWSC is 70% owned by \nthe Government. \n\n■■ There is no national electricity generation, distribution \nor transmission grid.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ With much fanfare (including an underwater cabinet \nmeeting highlighting the Maldives’ vulnerability to \nclimate change), former President Mohamed Nasheed \nannounced ambitious renewables targets for the \n\nMaldives in 2009, which included carbon neutrality \nfor the nation by 2020 and 100% renewables use \nby 2020. Successive administrations following \nPresident Nasheed have downgraded the Maldives’ \ncommitments. Most recently, as part of the Paris \nAgreement, the Maldives pledged to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emission by 10% before 2030.  \nThe Government has indicated that the chief manner \nin which it will achieve these reductions is through \nincreasing renewable energy generation.  \n\n■■ The current contribution of the renewables industry \nto energy supply is limited (confined largely to \nsolar water heaters in resorts). However, there are \nsignificant incentives for the Maldives to increase \nits renewables contribution, including the energy \ninsecurity caused by its almost complete reliance \non imported fuel, the cost of subsidising electricity \ngeneration and the difficulty in maintaining a constant \nelectricity supply across its archipelago.\n\n■■ A 2011 joint report by the Scottish and Maldivian \nGovernments estimated that the Maldives’ installed \nrenewables capacity was 209.8kW.\n\n■■ Impediments to renewables development in the \nMaldives include the scarcity of land and the visual \nimpact of any renewables projects in a nation reliant \non tourism. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ No wide-ranging assessments have been made as to \nthe Maldives’ hydropower energy potential (although \nthis is considered limited due to flat topography and \nland constraints).\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Limited assessments have been made of the Maldives’ \nwind prospects. An IRENA report indicated that \nonshore wind could be the second most lucrative \nrenewables sources in the Maldives (see below).  \n\n■■ Concerns over the visual impact of wind farms on \n‘island landscapes’ near tourist areas have been raised. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 61\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ The Maldives is located close to the equator and its \nislands have an average insolation of 5 to 5.5 kWh/m2 \nper day, which ideally positions the country for solar \nenergy usage. Currently, the use of solar energy is \nlargely restricted to tourist resorts, which use solar \nheating for half of their water heating requirements. \n\n■■ IRENA has identified solar photovoltaic as the most \nviable renewables source in the Maldives (see below). \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ No assessments have been made as to the Maldives’ \ngeothermal energy potential.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ The outer islands of the Maldives have used coconut \nhusks and shrubs as their primary energy source \nfor domestic purposes, but these households are \nincreasingly using kerosene and liquefied petroleum \ngas for cooking.\n\n■■ Landfill gas has been identified as a potential energy \nsource.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ In 2011, the Scottish and Maldivian Governments \npartnered to produce a report on the potential for \nthe development of wave, tidal and ocean thermal \nsources of renewable energy in the Maldives. The \nreport noted that ocean energy does not have the \n“visual footprint” associated with solar and wind \nenergy (which would be a concern for the Maldives \nbecause of its reliance on the tourism industry). \nAlthough the report commented that “in the \nforeseeable future marine energy from currents will \nbe part of the renewable energy portfolio in the \nMaldives”, it concluded that “it is unlikely that ocean \nthermal energy will form part of that portfolio”.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ In September 2015, IRENA released a comprehensive \nreport into renewable energy development in the \nMaldives. Some of IRENA’s key recommendations \nincluded:\n\n – current efforts at exploiting renewable energy \ncould be better directed;\n\n – the Government should set “ambitious, achievable \nand clearly identified” renewable energy goals. This \nwas due to a government announcement calling for \n30% of daytime peak load in all inhabited islands to \ncome from renewables by around 2020;\n\n – solar photovoltaic has the highest generation \npotential in the Maldives, with onshore wind the \nsecond highest potential;\n\n – the Maldives should consider importing \n“renewables fuels” such as biodiesel for use in \nexisting diesel generators, which currently operate \non a blend of traditional diesel and biodiesel.  \nIRENA noted that biodiesel generators could \nsupport renewables generators;\n\n – any renewables deployments should promote \nrenewables use in resort islands and tourism \nfacilities given the significant proportion of installed \ngeneration capacity from these islands and tourism \nfacilities; \n\n – the Maldives should consider revising its current \npolicy framework which “is not conducive to large-\nscale renewable energy deployment”; and\n\n – before large-scale renewables deployment, \ninterconnectors should be built between the main \nislands by undersea cables. \n\n■■ Despite some political uncertainity in recent years, the \ncountry is nonetheless performing well economically \nand anticipating strong investment. \n\n\n\n62 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS \n\n■■ The Maldives does not have a renewable energy \nlaw, however the country has initiated many policies \nconcerning renewable energy. Some of the most \nimportant Maldivian energy policies include the:\n\n – Renewable Energy Technology Development and \nApplication Project (2004);\n\n – Maldives Energy Action Plan (2009 – 2013);\n\n – Maldives National Energy Policy & Strategy (2010);\n\n – Maldives Renewable Energy Framework (2011);\n\n – Maldives Energy Policy (2011); and\n\n – Maldives Energy and Policy Strategy (2016).\n\n■■ In addition, the Maldives is participating in the Scaling-Up \nRenewable Energy in Low-Income Countries Program, \nwhich is backed by the Climate Investment Fund and \ninvolves renewables investments into a number of \ndeveloping countries. The Government is implementing \nthis program through the Maldives Scaling up Renewable \nEnergy Investment Plan (2013 – 2017). Two important \nsub-programs ‘sit’ underneath the plan: \n\n – Accelerating Sustainable Private Investment for \nRenewable Energy program (ASPIRE), which \namong other objectives, is seeking to commission \naround 4MW of rooftop solar projects in Malé and \nHulhamale, with an eventual target of 35MW to \n50MW of solar photovoltaic generation that will \nrequire more than US$60 million investment; and\n\n – Preparing Outer Islands for Sustainable Energy \nDevelopment Programme (POISED).  \nThis programme will support achieving full \nrenewable energy systems on 25 electricity \nconsuming islands through rehabilitating \ninefficient generators and making other necessary \nadjustments. The Asian Development Bank will be \nthe lead agency. The Asian Development Bank has \nprovided the Maldives’ Government with a loan to \nsupport the POISED project, which will provide 24-\nhour electricity supply to 40 outer islands.\n\n■■ Many energy plans focus on the capital of Malé, \nwhich is one of the highest density cities in the world \nand is home to a large proportion of the country’s \npopulation. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Renewable energy equipment is exempt from \nMaldivian duties.\n\n■■ General investment incentives are offered through \nthe Ministry of Economic Development and Invest \nMaldives. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Government will provide special incentives and \nconcessions for those investing and doing business in \nthe country’s Special Economic Zones. These zones \nhave been described as an integral part of the ongoing \nwork to stimulate economic growth in the Maldives.\n\n■■ Despite being a small country, the Maldives sits at the \njuncture of major powers.  The country is culturally \naligned with India, but also attracting significant \ninterest from China as the Maldives sits along \nPresident Xi Jinping’s ‘maritime silk road’. The Maldives \nis increasingly attracting foreign investment from the \nArab world too, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ In recent years, the Maldives’ Government has \ninitiated a number of policies and laws aimed at \nincreasing foreign investment. For instance, under a \n2015 revision to the Maldives’ Constitution, foreigners \nare permitted to own land if the investor reclaims \nmore than 70% of the land and invests more than \nUS$1 billion. Leases to foreign companies within the \ntourism sector are common. \n\n■■ Under the recently-passed Special Economic Zone \nAct (Act No. 24/2014), a company with 51% Maldivian \nholding is allowed to take a freehold interest in \nproperty.\n\n■■ Relevant laws in relation to foreign investment include:\n\n – Law on Foreigners Doing Business in the Maldives  \n(No. 4/79), which concerns the formation, \nregistration and operation of all foreign \ninvestments in the Maldives;\n\n – Companies Act (10/96); and\n\n – Regulation of Employment of Foreign Nationals  \n(2011/R-22), which requires employers to apply for a \nforeign worker quota.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 63\n\n■■ The Maldives’ Government has also established a one-\nstop shop for foreign investors called Invest Maldives, \nwhich advertises that foreign investors enjoy no foreign \nexchange restrictions, no restrictions on the repatriation \nof earnings and capital proceeds and right to 100% \nforeign ownership (although this excludes land).\n\n■■ Taxation rates in the Maldives are low by regional \nstandards, with a:\n\n – 6% general goods and services tax;\n\n – 12% tourism goods and services tax (in addition  \nto a small daily ‘green tax’ on tourists); \n\n – 10% withholding tax if certain payments are made to \na person not resident in the Maldives in a tax year;\n\n – 15% business profits tax; and\n\n – 15% tax on property transfer (although this is not \napplicable to foreigners because of the restrictions \non foreign land ownership).\n\n■■ There is presently no personal income tax (a bill \nproposing personal income tax in 2012 subsequently \nlapsed) nor different tax rates for foreigners as \ncompared with Maldivian nationals. In October 2016, the \nGovernment introduced a 3% remittance tax on money \ntransferred out of the Maldives by expatriate workers. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ The Maldives was among the first countries to \nratify the Paris Agreement on 4 April 2016 and in \nits Intended Nationally Determined Contribution \ncommitted the country to reducing its greenhouse \ngas emissions by 10% before 2030. The Maldives also \nset a conditional target of up to 24% by 2030 “in \nthe context of sustainable development, supported \nand enabled by availability of financial resources, \ntechnology transfer and capacity building”.\n\n■■ At the Paris Conference in December 2015,  \na message delivered on behalf of the Maldives’ \nPresident underlined the importance of climate \nchange mitigation and adaption efforts for the future \nof the country: “The Maldives believes that climate \nchange poses as the most pressing developmental and \nsecurity challenge of the 21st Century. As one of the \nworld’s lowest lying island nations, our country faces \npotentially devastating impacts if bold climate action is \nnot taken immediately.”\n\n\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Invest Maldives – http://investmaldives.gov.mv/index.php\n\n■■ Republic of Maldives, Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation \n2010-2020 – http://ndmc.gov.mv/assets/Uploads/Strategic-National-Action-Plan-for-Disaster-Risk-Reduction-and-\nClimate-Change-Adaptation-2010-2020-Provisional-Draft.pdf\n\n■■ Republic of Maldives, National Energy Policy and Strategy – http://www.environment.gov.mv/v1/wp-content/blogs.\ndir/1/files/publications/20131212-Pub-Maldives-National-Energy-Policy-and-Strategy-2010.pdf\n\n■■ Guide for investing in Maldives Special Economic Zones – http://www.sez.gov.mv/downloads/Guidlines_for_SEZ_\napplication.pdf \n\n■■ Scaling-Up Renewable Energy Program – The Maldives – http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/country/maldives \n\n■■ Renewable Energy Maldives – http://test.renewableenergymaldives.com.mv/AboutUs/ \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ Reegle, Energy Profile Maldives, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/maldives-energy-profile/MV \n\n■■ World Bank, Maldives: Country Snapshot, accessed at:  http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/\nen/547601476772013083/pdf/109250-WP-MaldivesCountrySnapshots-HighRes-PUBLIC.pdf\n\n■■ IRENA, Renewable Energy Roadmap: The Republic of Maldives, accessed at: http://www.irena.org/EventDocs/Maldives/\nMaldivesroadmapbackgroundreport.pdf\n\n■■ Maldives Economic Vision 2013 - 2018, Building a Sustainable & Vibrant Economy, accessed at: http://\npresidencymaldives.gov.mv/Documents/maldives_open_for_investment.pdf\n\n■■ President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom’s message for the opening day of the 21st session of Conference of the Parties \n(COP), accessed at: http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=16136\n\n64 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttp://investmaldives.gov.mv/index.php\nhttp://ndmc.gov.mv/assets/Uploads/Strategic-National-Action-Plan-for-Disaster-Risk-Reduction-and-Climate-Change-Adaptation-2010-2020-Provisional-Draft.pdf\nhttp://ndmc.gov.mv/assets/Uploads/Strategic-National-Action-Plan-for-Disaster-Risk-Reduction-and-Climate-Change-Adaptation-2010-2020-Provisional-Draft.pdf\nhttp://www.environment.gov.mv/v1/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/publications/20131212-Pub-Maldives-National-Energy-Policy-and-Strategy-2010.pdf\nhttp://www.environment.gov.mv/v1/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/publications/20131212-Pub-Maldives-National-Energy-Policy-and-Strategy-2010.pdf\nhttp://www.sez.gov.mv/downloads/Guidlines_for_SEZ_application.pdf\nhttp://www.sez.gov.mv/downloads/Guidlines_for_SEZ_application.pdf\nhttp://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/country/maldives\nhttp://test.renewableenergymaldives.com.mv/AboutUs/\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/maldives-energy-profile/MV\nhttp://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547601476772013083/pdf/109250-WP-MaldivesCountrySnapshots-HighRes-PUBLIC.pdf\nhttp://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/547601476772013083/pdf/109250-WP-MaldivesCountrySnapshots-HighRes-PUBLIC.pdf\nhttp://www.irena.org/EventDocs/Maldives/Maldivesroadmapbackgroundreport.pdf\nhttp://www.irena.org/EventDocs/Maldives/Maldivesroadmapbackgroundreport.pdf\nhttp://presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Documents/maldives_open_for_investment.pdf\nhttp://presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Documents/maldives_open_for_investment.pdf\nhttp://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=16136\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 65\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Civil law \n\nLanguage: Mongolian\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 64 of 190 (down 2 rankings) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 102 of 138 (up 2 rankings)\n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 129 of 180 (down 29 rankings) \n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 87 of 176 (down 15 rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 90 of 188 (up 13 rankings)\n\nPopulation: 3.1 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$3,870 \n\nPROFILE\n\nMongolia is the second largest landlocked country and the most sparsely populated country in the world. \nMongolia gained international recognition as a sovereign State in 1945. Due to its location, both the Chinese \nand Soviet Union heavily influenced the development of the country’s culture, economy and institutions. \nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mongolia became a democratic republic in 1990. However, \nmore ethnic Mongols live in present-day Inner Mongolia, which is a northern province of China on Mongolia’s \nsouthern border. The capital, Ulaanbaatar, is currently home to 45% of the population. Approximately 30% of \nMongols are nomadic or semi-nomadic.\n\nMONGOLIA\n\n\n\n66 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Much of the foreign interest in Mongolia centres \naround its mineral wealth. Several large fossil fuel and \nmetal-based mines have now opened in Mongolia. \nAt present, the majority of electricity generating \ncapacity comes from coal-fired thermal plants, \nwhich in 2015 accounted for 85% of total electricity \ncapacity. The remaining 15% comes from diesel (7%), \nwind power (5%), hydropower (2%) and small-scale \nrenewable energy (1%).\n\n■■ Mongolia’s energy sector is currently struggling to \nmeet the country’s growing need for electricity. \nEnergy consumption is also increasing across the \ndomestic and industrial sector, as mining activities \ncontinue and individual household energy demand \nincreases. In response, the Government has \ncommissioned various renewable and non-renewable \nprojects in an attempt to meet demand. \n\n■■ Mongolia has seasonal variations in electricity demand. \nVery cold winters require additional energy to be \nimported from Russia for heating. Electricity is also \nimported from China to supply the country’s southern \nborder towns and the Oyu Tolgoi mine, which is \nlocated in the Southern Gobi Desert. \n\n■■ The increasing price of Russian electricity, inefficient \ninfrastructure and the low cost of electricity for \nconsumers is threatening the financial viability of \nMongolia’s electricity providers. The World Bank and \nUSAID estimate that the price of electricity will need \nto increase by at least 60% for the energy industry to \ncover the costs of providing electricity to consumers. \nAccording to the 2016 Doing Business Project, the \nprice of electricity in Mongolia is US$0.069 per kWh. \n\nPresent and future demand\n\n■■ Industry (principally, the mining industry) is the \nbiggest consumer of electricity in Mongolia, followed \nby household users. According to a 2014 study from \nthe International Energy Agency, industry consumed \napproximately 3,100GWh of electricity, compared \nto approximately 1,200GWh consumed by the \nresidential sector. The Government of Mongolia \nestimates that 500 to 600MW will be added to \nexisting demand by 2020. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The following laws, regulations and legal documents \nrelate to the energy regulation process in Mongolia: \n\n – Energy Law;\n\n – Energy Conservation Law;\n\n – Concession Law;\n\n – Economic Activity Licenses Law;\n\n – Civil Code;\n\n – Administrative Responsibility Law (to be invalid \nfrom 1 July 2017);\n\n – Violations law to be effective from 1 July 2017; \n\n – Consumers Rights Protection Law;\n\n – Minerals Law;\n\n – Renewable Energy Law; and\n\n – Competition Law.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ The Mongolian electricity distribution system is made \nup of four independently operating grids, namely the:\n\n – Central Energy System, which provides more than \n90% of the national electricity supply and serves \nUlaanbaatar and surrounding areas. It is comprised \nof five coal powered plants and an interconnection \nwith Russia; \n\n – Eastern Energy System, which has one combined \nheat and power plant; \n\n – Western Energy System, which relies on the \nimportation of electricity from Russia; and \n\n – Altai-Uliastai Energy System. \n\nGovernment\n\n■■ The Mongolian Government plays an active part in the \nrenewables industry through a number of ministries \nand authorities:\n\n – The Ministry for Energy is responsible for \nformulating energy policies and also approves \nforeign investment;\n\n\n\n – The Energy Regulatory Commission of Mongolia \nundertakes broad research into and technical \nmonitoring of the energy sector. One of the \ndivisions within the Commission is the Renewable \nEnergy Division. The Energy Regulatory \nCommission is responsible for fixing energy \nprices, issuing licenses, setting tariffs and generally \nregulating the sector; \n\n – The Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer \nProtection is tasked with addressing anti-\ncompetitive behaviour;\n\n – The National Committee on Reduction of Air \nPollution is charged with reducing the high pollution \nlevels in Ulaanbaatar; and\n\n – The National Renewable Energy Centre and the \nMinistry of Environment and Tourism.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The Mongolian Government set targets in its 2014 \nGreen Development Policy to increase the share \nof renewable energy in the total installed power \ngeneration capacity, with a view to reaching 20% by \n2020 and 30% by 2030. Given the significant role \nfossil fuels play in Mongolia’s current energy mix, \nthe country has an urgent need to diversify its fuel \nportfolio in order to achieve these ambitious targets.\n\n■■ Mongolia has an abundance of renewable energy \nresources, and has tried to adopt renewable energy \ntechnologies in line with local needs. According to \nits 2009 findings, the National Renewable Energy \nCentre estimates that Mongolia’s wind energy and \nsolar potential could be as high as 2.6TW. Further, \naccording to the 7th National Renewable Energy \nForum, there is potential to deliver wind and solar \nenergy of over 2.5 trillion kWh per year. \n\n■■ In response to these findings, the President of \nMongolia, Mr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, has established the \nGobitec concept, which aims to connect locations \nof high energy demand with the Gobi Desert region, \nwhich has a large renewable energy potential. As part \nof the concept, research is being conducted to \ndetermine how the energy produced in the region can \nbe delivered via power corridors that would connect \nRussia, Mongolia, China, South Korea and Japan. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Mongolia’s 3,800 small and big streams and rivers, \nwhich are located primarily in the northern and \nwestern areas of the country, have the potential for \nthe generation of up to 6.4GW of hydropower and are \nable to deliver 56.2 billion kWh of energy per year.\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 67\n\n\n\n68 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ While a feasibility and environmental impact \nassessment for the Egiin Hydropower Power Plant \nwas completed in 2013, the project has stalled. \nThe Government cited trans-boundary issues and \nenvironmental concerns as the reason for the halt of \nthe 315MW capacity project. As of February 2017, the \nMongolian Government is negotiating with the Russian \nGovernment to resolve issues related to this project. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ About 10% of Mongolia’s total territory has been \ndeemed as suitable for wind projects, with the \ncountry’s wind energy potential amounting to at least \n1.1TW. The Gobi Desert is a suitable place for the \nconstruction of wind power plants.\n\n■■ The Salkhit wind farm (52MW) has been in operation \nsince 2013. Another 52MW wind farm project \ncommenced in 2016 in Sainshand, with an expected \ncompletion date in 2017.\n\n Solar energy\n\n■■ Solar potential in Mongolia is quite high. The Gobi \nDesert is particularly suitable, with 300 days \nof sunshine per year, low moisture and high \ntemperatures. The largest solar power plant, located \nin Darkhan, officially commenced operations on \n19 January 2017 and has begun supplying electricity \nto the city’s main electricity grid. The 10MW power \nstation was built by Solar Power International, \nin cooperation with two Japanese multinational \ncorporations. The plant also contains 32,000 solar \nbatteries, with most equipment being supplied by the \nGerman company SMA Solar Technology AG and the \nSwedish company ABB. \n\n■■ Since 1999, the Government of Mongolia has run the \n‘100,000 Solar Ger Program’ with the aim of providing \nrural families, mostly nomadic households, with a set \nof basic mobile solar photovoltaic systems, to supply \nelectricity for basic needs such as lighting, radio and \nTV. The project is jointly funded by the World Bank \nand Dutch Government and provides a 50% subsidy on \nthe cost of solar systems.\n\n■■ Today, the 100,000 household target has been \nexceeded. However, given the limited capacity these \nsystems can provide, it only meets very basic energy \ndemand. There may be a need to upgrade these \nsystems given more domestic appliances are used \ntoday, as a result of improved living standards. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Comprehensive geothermal resource surveys have \nnot been undertaken in Mongolia. Geothermal energy \nis yet to be fully explored and developed. So far, \n43 possible geothermal sites have been identified, with \nprojects at Tsenkher, Khujirt and Shargaljuut in the \nKhangai region deemed the most feasible.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ The biofuel potential of the country has not been \nextensively explored. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency reportedly conducted research \ninto Mongolian biofuel as early as 1993, however there \nare no such facilities currently in Mongolia. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ A major issue currently affecting the renewables \nindustry is the insufficient financing for projects under \nthe Government’s Renewable Energy Fund. Without \nsufficient finance, the incremental cost of projects is \nplacing strain on the Government’s budget and may \ndiscourage future investment in the renewables sector. \n\n■■ In 2013, China announced its ‘One Belt, One Road’ \npolicy, which would see the development of six major \neconomic corridors connecting China, Central Asia, \nWest Asia and parts of South Asia. One of those \ncorridors would connect China, Mongolia and Russia \nand would be the site of new energy and industrial \nclusters. Construction has not yet commenced.\n\n■■ The Mongolian Government has actively explored the \npossibility of developing a regional integrated power \nmarket in northeast Asia through which it can export \nwind and solar electricity to other countries. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 69\n\n■■ Despite its vast potential, the Government may \nchoose to reduce renewables investment given the \nurgency of power shortfalls and the affordability of \ncoal-generated electricity. In recent years, proposals \nhave been made to export coal-fired power to China. \nOne proposal involved a coal-fired power plant of \n3,600MW with a high voltage direct current power \nline extending from the Shivee Ovoo coal field to \nBeijing.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Energy Law 2001 regulates matters of energy \ngeneration, transmission, distribution and dispatching, \nopens the industry to private investment and \ncoordinates supply activities, as well as infrastructure \nmatters. It was last amended in December 2015.\n\n■■ The Renewable Energy Law 2007 regulates the setting \nof tariffs in order to facilitate the development of \nclean energy production from renewable energy \nsources. The law also introduced the first long-term \nPower Purchase Agreement between the Central \nEnergy System Transmission Network, a state-owned \nstock company, and Newcom Holdings.\n\n■■ The Concession Law 2010 laid the foundations for \nprivate investment in state and locally owned assets, \nwithout privatisation. Under this law, energy sources \ndeveloped with private investment are eligible for \ngovernment concessions. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The Government offers a variety of incentives \nfor renewable investments, particularly from the \nfeed-in tariff rates. The most generous tariffs are \nprovided in solar energy, with tariffs also for wind and \nhydropower energy.\n\n■■ The feed-in tariff system in Mongolia has experienced \nissues in the past few years with the stipulation \nthat the rates should be paid in US dollars. While \nthis favours foreign investors by reducing the \ncurrency exchange risk, the Mongolian currency has \ndramatically depreciated against the US dollar. In \n2016 alone, the Mongolian tugrik dropped nearly 12% \nagainst the US dollar. This has placed financial pressure \non the Government to deliver on its promised tariffs. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ In 2013, the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development invested US$47 million to help \nMongolia build its first wind energy project. The \nSalkhit wind farm was Mongolia’s first-ever private \nenergy enterprise, and was developed by the Newcom \nGroup. It is located 70km south of Ulaanbataar, and \nhas a 50MW capacity, which represents 5% of the \ncountry’s total electricity needs. It was connected to \nthe country’s central electricity grid in June 2013. \n\n■■ In September 2016, Clean Energy Asia LLC, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development signed \nfinancing agreements for the construction of a 50MW \nwind farm in Southern Mongolia. Operations are \nintended to commence in December 2017. \n\n■■ Newcom Group signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding in July 2016 with Korea Electric Power \nCorporation and Softbank Group to jointly explore \ninvestment opportunities in Mongolia’s renewable \nenergy sector. The intention behind the memorandum \nis to develop up to 10GW of power production. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Foreign direct investment is critical for Mongolia’s \neconomic growth, and the foreign investment regime \nis considered to be very open. In 2013, the Mongolian \nGovernment introduced the Investment Law to \nprotect the rights and interests of foreign investors \nin Mongolia. The law regulates the provision of tax \nstabilisation certificates that provide for fixed taxation \nrates, strengthens arbitration rights and facilitates \nthe repatriation of profits. It was last amended in \nNovember 2016.\n\n■■ In 2015, foreign investment in Mongolia decreased \ndue to delays in decision-making regarding mining \nactivities. In response to this slump, the Government \ndecided to lift the moratorium on exploration licenses. \nHowever, foreign investors remain wary in response to \nthe Government suspending a number of exploration \npermits in 2014 due to a corruption investigation. \nMongolia’s main investment partners are China, Canada, \nRussia, Great Britain and the United States. \n\n\n\n70 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Mongolia ratified the Paris Agreement on \n21 September 2016 and committed to curbing its \ngreenhouse gases and measuring corresponding \nresults.\n\n■■ Almost one-third of Mongolia’s population still \nrelies on traditional sectors such as agriculture and \npastoral animal husbandry. These communities are \nvulnerable to extreme weather that often results \nin economic loss. In response, part of Mongolia’s \nIntended Nationally Determined Contribution outlines \nmeasures to be adopted to support sustainable \ndevelopment and improve Mongolia’s resilience to \nclimate change. \n\n■■ Mongolia has also committed to a number of policies \nand measures across the energy industry, and the \nagriculture and waste sectors. The expected impact of \nthese measures will be a 14% reduction in projected \nemissions by 2030. Achieving this goal is contingent \nupon gaining access to new technologies and finance \nthrough internationally organised mechanisms and \ninstruments. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 71\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ National Renewable Energy Centre – http://www.renenergy.com/start1.html \n\n■■ Newcom Group – http://www.newcom.mn/en/company/26 \n\n■■ Asian and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology of the United Nations – Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific report: Mongolia’s Renewable Energy – http://recap.apctt.org/Countries/PDF/Mongolia_\nCountryReport.pdf \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ Reegle, Energy Profile Mongolia, accessed at: http:// www.reegle.info/countries/mongolia-energy-profile/MN \n\n■■ Energici, Mongolia – Renewable Energy Profile, accessed at: http://www.energici.com/energy-profiles/by-country/asia-\nm-z/mongolia \n\n■■ European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Mongolia, accessed at: http://ws223.myload spring.com/sites/\nrenew/countries/Mongolia/profile.aspx \n\n■■ Michael Kohn, Mongolia’s Parliament Approves Changes to Foreign Investment Law, accessed at: http://www.bloomberg.\ncom/news/2013-04-19/mongolia-sparliament-approves-changes-to-foreign-investmentlaw.html \n\n■■ International Renewable Energy Agency, Mongolia Renewable Readiness Assessment, accessed at: \nhttp://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/IRENA_RRA_Mongolia_2016.pdf \n\nhttp://www.renenergy.com/start1.html\nhttp://www.newcom.mn/en/company/26\nhttp://recap.apctt.org/Countries/PDF/Mongolia_CountryReport.pdf\nhttp://recap.apctt.org/Countries/PDF/Mongolia_CountryReport.pdf\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/mongolia-energy-profile/MN\nhttp://www.energici.com/energy-profiles/by-country/asia-m-z/mongolia\nhttp://www.energici.com/energy-profiles/by-country/asia-m-z/mongolia\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/mongolia-sparliament-approves-changes-to-foreign-investmentlaw.html\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-19/mongolia-sparliament-approves-changes-to-foreign-investmentlaw.html\nhttp://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/IRENA_RRA_Mongolia_2016.pdf\n\n\n72 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Common law and customary law\n\nLanguage: Burmese\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 170 out of 190 (up 1 ranking)\n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: Not listed\n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 146 out of 180 (up 12 rankings)\n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 136 of 176 (up 11 rankings)\n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 148 of 188 (up 2 rankings)\n\nPopulation: 51.5 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$1,293\n\nPROFILE\n\nMyanmar (or Burma) attained independence in 1948. This was the start of a long period of military rule, civil \nunrest, ethnic conflict and isolation from the outside world. In November 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi’s National \nLeague for Democracy secured victory in the country’s elections. The country is now embarking on a major \npolitical and economic transformation, led by Suu Kyi and Myanmar’s President, Htin Kyaw. International \ncommentators have expressed concern over human rights issues in Myanmar’s west. \n\nMYANMAR\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 73\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ As of January 2015, Myanmar’s total electricity \ncapacity was estimated to be 4,456MW.\n\n■■ In 2016, electricity capacity consisted of:\n\n – hydropower (65%);\n\n – gas (33%);\n\n – coal (2%); and\n\n – other renewables (negligible). \n\n■■ In 2016, most of the country’s generation capacity \ncame from 39 power plants consisting of 25 \nhydropower plants, 13 gas-fired and one local coal \nfired power plant.\n\n■■ In January 2016, the National Energy Management \nCommittee released the Myanmar Energy Master \nPlan. This Master Plan is the first comprehensive \nenergy policy since the recent elections. Projections \nfrom the Master Plan for contributions towards \ntotal electricity generation include:\n\n – hydropower to decrease from around 70% \n(at 2012 levels) to 57% by 2030; \n\n – natural gas to decrease from around 28% to 8% \nin 2030;\n\n – solar photovoltaic to increase from 0% to 5% in \n2030; and\n\n – coal to increase from 2% to 30% by 2030.\n\n■■ At a December 2016 conference, 422 civil society \norganisations called on the new government to halt \nplans for new coal plants and mega dams. \n\n■■ Myanmar’s consumption of electricity has \nskyrocketed in recent years. Power consumption in \n2013 was 164.46kWh per capita, an increase from \n78.3 kWh per capita only a decade earlier. \n\n■■ Despite the significant increase in per capita \nconsumption of energy, in 2013 Myanmar still had \none of the lower rates of energy consumption in \nthe world. \n\n■■ Yangon has a relatively high electrification rate \n(approximately 78%), with rural areas averaging about \n20% electrification. The Government wants uniform \n100% electrification by 2030.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Law 2014 was enacted by Parliament \non 27 October 2014, replacing a previous 1984 \nAct. The Law established the Electricity Regulatory \nCommission, which has powers to regulate and \ncontrol electricity rates. It is responsible for \nformulating policy, preparing tariffs, setting standards, \nadvising the Ministry of Electric Power and performing \ninspections. The Law also grants permission for \nforeigners to invest in the electricity sector.\n\n■■ Other important electricity regulations include the:\n\n – Electricity Rules 1985, which are still in effect, \nto the extent that they do not conflict with the \nnew electricity laws. At the time of publication, \nelectricity regulations and a rural electrification law \nhave been drafted but not yet implemented; and\n\n – National Environment Policy 1994. At the time of \npublication, a New National Environmental Policy is \nin the final stages of drafting and is expected to be \nimplemented in 2017.\n\nGovernment\n\n■■ In broad terms, Myanmar’s electricity is structured \naround a state-owned single buyer model with two \n‘off-taker’ entities. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Electric Power was merged into \none ministry and is now both the supervisor and \nfacilitator of the power sector in Myanmar. A number \nof departments with varying roles exist under the \nMinistry.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Myanmar has significant potential for growth \nand development in its renewable energy sector. \nGeographically, Myanmar is the largest country in \n\n\n\n74 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nSoutheast Asia and has an abundance of natural \nresources. The utilisation of these materials for \nrenewable energy has been hampered due to decades \nof civil unrest and political and economic isolation. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Myanmar currently boasts a total of 26 hydropower \nplants generating a total of 9,398.98GWh. The \ninstallation capacity of this power includes 3,185MW \ninstalled on grid, and 34MW off grid.\n\n■■ Myanmar has a hydropower potential of over 100GW \nfrom its four main river basins: Ayeyarwaddy, \nChindwin, Thanlwin and Sittaun. \n\n■■ By early 2015, there were 302 hydropower projects \nin the country with a theoretical capacity of \n46,330MW. However, only 3,011MW is connected \nto the national grid.\n\n■■ Environmental concerns surrounding hydropower \nresulted in the cancellation of Myitsone dam in 2011, \nfollowed by the cancellation of two more large-scale \nhydropower projects in the Htamanthi and Shwezaye \nregion. A relatively recent hydropower project in the \nShan region, which is expected to generate more than \n7,000MW of electricity has also attracted some local \nopposition due to environmental concerns.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ The wind sector is very undeveloped in Myanmar. \nWind speeds are generally low throughout the \ncountry. Further research is underway to determine \nthe effectiveness of small-scale or off-grid wind power. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Despite high solar radiation levels, mountainous \nterrain, dispersed populations, lack of financing and \npoor transmission infrastructure are some current \ninhibitors to utility-scaled solar farms. \n\n■■ The country is targeting 5% of total electricity \ngeneration to come from solar by 2030. Given the \nvery undeveloped state of the solar sector, this will \nrequire significant investment.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Eastern Myanmar has been identified as an area with \ngreat opportunity for geothermal energy production. \nDifferent organisations have taken an interest in this \npotential, with the Myanmar Engineering Society \nalready nominating at least 39 locations suitable for \ngeothermal energy production. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ A majority of the country’s energy comes from \nbiomass, chiefly for lighting and cooking in rural areas.\n\n■■ Biogas generators have been used to supplement fuel \nwood scarcity.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Like many other sectors of the economy, a lack of \nregulation is hampering the development of the \nrenewables industry. The Energy Master Plan was a big \nstep forward for the energy sector, as were reforms \nto the electricity legislation. However, the country will \nlikely require a specific renewable energy framework \nto have a strong chance of achieving its ambitious 2030 \nrenewable energy targets. \n\n■■ An abundance of untapped fossil fuel resources, \nespecially in northern regions, may prove a distraction \nto any serious government efforts at commissioning \nlarge-scale solar photovoltaic farms.\n\n■■ Adequate transmission infrastructure is also a \nparticular problem. Myanmar’s mountainous terrain, \nthe need for local community support across an \nethnically diverse nation, and Myanmar’s size are \nall contributing factors to Myanmar’s transmission \ninfrastructure challenges. \n\n■■ The Myanmar Investment Commission has permitted \n100% foreign ownership in small and medium-scale \nhydropower plants and coal-fired plants.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ There is presently no renewable energy law in \nMyanmar.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 75\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Despite no incentives specifically targeting renewables, \nforeign investors can still have general incentives \napplied to renewable projects. According to the \nAsian Development Bank, these include five-year tax \nholidays, tax reductions of up to 50% for exports, \nresearch and development expense reductions and \nexemptions from customs duties for certain imports.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ Development is underway for a 220MW solar \nphotovoltaic plant which will be built in Minbu, \nin the Magway region of Myanmar. The project is a \ncollaborative venture from Thailand’s Green Earth \nPower and Black and Veatch, an engineering and \nconstruction firm.\n\n■■ In 2016, a 300MW solar deal was signed between \nYangon-based Won Toll and Thailand’s Kumrai Panit. \n\n■■ Eleven solar micro-grid projects in remote \ncommunities are contracted to be developed by \nSunlabob Renewable Energy, a Laos based company, \nwhich will be funded by the Japanese International \nCooperation System.\n\n■■ In 2015, Myanmar secured a US$400 million loan \nfrom the World Bank targeting solar, wind and diesel \ngeneration. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Myanmar Foreign Investment Law 2012 (FIL) which \nwas passed by the Myanmar National Assembly on \n2 November 2012 and approved by President Thein \nSein the next day, is a crucial part of the Government \nof Myanmar’s push to attract foreign investment and \nre-form the country’s once isolated economy.\n\n■■ The effect of the FIL is to incentivise investors, and \nso it restricts investment in only a small number of \nindustries. The objectives and ‘fundamental principles’ \nof the FIL recognise the need to create jobs, develop \nbasic infrastructure and reform the country’s once-\nisolated industry. \n\nMyanmar Investment Commission\n\n■■ The Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) is created \nunder the FIL. The MIC’s chief duty is to scrutinise the \ninvestment proposals and to accept proposals that are \nin the State’s interests. It is comprised of members \nfrom various Ministries, government departments and \norganisations as well as other non-government persons. \nThe MIC will grant the final confirmation/approval for \nforeign investors to utilise land for power plants. On \ntop of this, foreign investors must ensure they obtain an \ninvestment licence from the MIC.\n\nRestricted and prohibited activities\n\n■■ The FIL has both general and specific restrictions and \nprohibitions. The general restrictions and prohibitions \nrelate to preserving cultures and customs of ethnic \nnationalities, activities detrimental to public health, \nnatural resources, the environment and biodiversity, as \nwell as the importation of toxic waste products or the \nuse of hazardous chemicals.\n\n■■ The specific restrictions and prohibitions relate to \nindustries that “can be operated by [Myanmar] citizens” \nsuch as agricultural activities, livestock activities \nand fishery activities. There are also restrictions \non manufacturing and service activities, subject to \nregulations underneath the FIL. As regulations have yet \nto be passed, there is no guidance as to whether any \nparticular industry is ‘restricted’ or ‘prohibited’.\n\n■■ Nonetheless, the MIC may permit investments in \nrestricted or prohibited sectors with approval from \nthe Union Government Board. It is also important to \nnote that the State-Owned Economic Enterprises Law gives \nthe Government the sole right to carry out economic \nenterprises in a number of sectors.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Myanmar signed the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016 \nand committed to playing its part in the global effort to \nmitigate emissions. In its Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution, Myanmar indicated its initial focus would \nbe on ‘carbon sinks’ and combatting deforestation.\n\n\n\n76 | Renewable energy in the

The \ncountry geographically comprises two main landmasses. The North Island, or Maori Te Ika-a-Māui, and the \nSouth Island, or Te Waipounamu. New Zealand was colonised by the British in the 19th century. In 1840, the \nMaori Indigenous chiefs agreed to the Treaty of Waitangi, which ceded sovereignty to the British Crown \nwhilst also retaining territorial rights for the Indigenous Maori population. In the 1980s, government policies \ntransformed the economy into an open and free market, which contributed significantly to the high standard \nof living which New Zealanders enjoy today. The agriculture and tourism industries are the two key sectors in \nthe economy today. New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary elections every three years.\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\n\n\n78 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In 2015, 42,876.5GWh of electricity was generated \nin New Zealand. New Zealand does not rely heavily \non fossil fuels. 80.8% of electricity is generated from \nrenewable sources. In 2015, electricity generation \ncomprised of:\n\n – 56.6% from hydropower;\n\n – 17.2% from geothermal;\n\n – 14.9% from gas;\n\n – 5.4% from wind;\n\n – 4.1% from coal;\n\n – 0.8% from wood;\n\n – 0.5% from biogas;\n\n – 0.1% from waste heat; and\n\n – 0.08% from solar.\n\n■■ Electricity demand is expected to grow at 1% per \nannum until 2030.\n\nELECTRICITY LAWS\n\n■■ Like many sectors in the economy, the energy sector \nunderwent major reforms during the 1980s and 1990s. \nThe reforms deregulated the market and limited the \nreach of state monopolies. The Electricity Act 1992 \nsets out the overall regulatory framework for the \nelectricity industry. The Electricity Industry Participation \nCode 2010 governs the operation of the electricity \nmarket. \n\n■■ The Electricity Industry Act 2010 was a result of a \nministerial review of the electricity sector. The \nAct has sought to improve competition within the \nelectricity market, enhance security of supply and it \nalso abolished the Electricity Commission, replacing it \nwith the Electricity Authority. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment \nadvises the Government on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy matters. The Minister of Energy and \nResources is responsible for the New Zealand Energy \nEfficiency and Conservation Strategy. The National \nEnergy Research Institute conducts energy research \nwithin New Zealand. \n\n■■ Transpower New Zealand Limited, being the sole \nowner and operator of the New Zealand national bulk \nelectricity transmission grid, is subject to individual \nprice-quality regulation under Part 4 of the Commerce \nAct 1986.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ In New Zealand, electricity is generated by five \nmajor electricity generating companies. Genesis \nEnergy, Mighty River Power and Meridian Energy \noperate under a mixed ownership model in which \nthe Government holds a majority stake. Contact and \nTrustpower are private sector companies.\n\n■■ In 2014, the generation share comprised: \n\n – Meridian Energy (35%);\n\n – Contact Energy (23%);\n\n – Mighty River Power (16%);\n\n – Genesis Energy (14%);\n\n – Trustpower (6%); and\n\n – the remainder made up from a number of smaller \ngenerating companies.\n\n■■ Generation companies own and operate power \nstations across the country. Most of New Zealand’s \nelectricity is generated at remote locations and \nrequires an efficient transmission system to transport \nit to the main centres. More than 200 generation \nplants are able to supply electricity to the national \ngrid. Some of the smaller scale generation is \n‘embedded’ and feeds directly into local distribution \nnetworks. \n\n■■ Transpower New Zealand Limited is the sole owner \nand operator of the New Zealand national bulk \nelectricity transmission grid.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In 2015, New Zealand generated over 80% of its \nelectricity needs from renewable energy. The country \nis a global leader in renewable energy generation, \nparticularly for geothermal energy. The International \nEnergy Agency released a report in 2016, stating that \nNew Zealand has the third highest contribution of \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 79\n\nrenewable energy to total primary energy supply in \nthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment, behind Iceland and Norway.\n\n■■ The Government has set a renewable energy target of \n90% by 2025. This is significantly higher than any other \ncountry in the region and reflects the advanced state \nof renewable energy in the country. \n\n■■ The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority \nis the chief government body for the promotion of \nrenewable energy. It reports to the Minister of Energy \nand Resources. The Ministry for the Environment also \nplays an active role in the renewable energy industry, \nparticularly insofar as it affects New Zealand’s climate \nchange program.\n\n■■ New Zealand has had an emission trading scheme \nsince 2008, however its success to date has been \nlimited due to subsequent amendments lessening \nthe impact of the scheme and the slow international \npickup with such schemes.\n\n■■ Historically, geothermal energy and hydropower have \ncontributed the largest proportion of New Zealand’s \nrenewable energy growth. Future growth is expected \nto come from wind energy, given the country’s \nattractive wind speeds, and also from further \ngeothermal projects. \n\nHydropower \n\n■■ Hydropower contributes about 56% of the \ncountry’s total electricity use. Most of the country’s \nhydropower capacity and potential is located in \nthe South Island. New Zealand’s two largest river \nsystems, the Waikato in the North Island and the \nClutha in the South Island, hold many of the country’s \nlargest hydropower stations. Many of the country’s \nmost lucrative hydropower sites have already \nbeen developed. Proposals for the development of \nfurther sites have been met with stiff environmental \nopposition. Due to New Zealand’s reliance on \nhydropower, drier months have resulted in electricity \nshortages in the past.\n\n■■ New Zealand has a long history of hydropower \nfacilities. The Waipori scheme (commissioned in 1903) \nand the Coleridge plant (commissioned in 1914), were \nthe earliest hydropower stations in the country. By \n\nthe 1950s, New Zealand had over 1GW of installed \nhydropower and in 1965 a high voltage transmission \nline from Benmore in the South Island to Haywards in \nthe North Island was constructed. This line resulted in \nmore hydropower stations in the South Island (such as \nthe 540MW Benmore station, the 750MW Manapouri \nstation and the 432MW Clyde dam) and hydropower \ngeneration reached 5GW by the 1990s. New Zealand’s \nhydropower capacity has remained steady since then.\n\nWind\n\n■■ Wind-sourced electricity accounts for over 5% \nof New Zealand’s total electricity needs. Natural \nconditions throughout New Zealand are highly \nconducive to developing wind projects, both onshore \nin mountainous areas and along the coast, as well \nas offshore. New Zealand has 18 wind farms either \noperating or under construction. These range from \na single small turbine at Southbridge (100kW) to the \nthree stages of the Tararua wind farm, which has \n134 turbines with a capacity of 161MW. West Wind, \nnear Wellington, is the largest wind farm built in one \nstage in New Zealand. Its 62 2.3MW turbines have a \ncombined generating capacity of 142.6MW. \n\n■■ There is currently 2,500MW of wind generation \nconsented in New Zealand and developers are \nexploring sites throughout New Zealand for new \nwind farm sites. \n\n■■ Both national and local standards regulate the \nmaximum noise levels that can be emitted from \nwind turbines. \n\n■■ Wind power capacity increased 19% from 2010 to \n2011, and increased over 6% from 2014 to 2015. \nOverall, wind generation capacity has increased by an \naverage of 30% per year over the last decade. \n\nSolar\n\n■■ Solar generation is currently a small proportion of \nNew Zealand’s energy supply, making up only 0.08% of \nits total renewable energy. \n\n■■ Price reductions in solar photovoltaic equipment \nhave made it more popular with homeowners and \nbusinesses, despite the fact that for most it remains \n\nhttp://www.windenergy.org.nz/southbridge-wind-turbine\nhttp://www.windenergy.org.nz/tararua-wind-farm\nhttp://www.windenergy.org.nz/west-wind-wind-farm\n\n\n80 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nmore costly than grid-supplied electricity. Residential \nsolar power is likely to contribute to changes in \nNew Zealand’s energy market design, energy policy \nand pricing structures in the future.\n\nGeothermal\n\n■■ All of New Zealand’s geothermal generation is in the \nNorth Island, mostly around the Taupo Volcanic Zone. \nGeothermal-sourced electricity makes up more than \n17% of the country’s electricity needs. \n\n■■ Geothermal capacity is approaching 1GW, which is \nlargely due to two older, large-scale geothermal plants \nand several more recent, smaller-scale geothermal \nplants. Geothermal energy is used for direct heating \nin some parts of New Zealand. As a world-leader in \ngeothermal generation and research, New Zealand \nhas signed agreements with other countries who are \nseeking to boost their own geothermal capacity.\n\nBiomass/biogas\n\n■■ The biomass industry is also well-established in \nNew Zealand, in the biomass such as converting \norganic waste from landfills to energy, liquid biofuels \ndeveloping alternative transport fuel and wood energy. \nWood-processing facilities produce a lot of the \ncountry’s biomass energy.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ The Kaipara tidal power station was a proposed \ntidal power project to be located in the Kaipara \nHarbour with an ultimate size of 200MW at a cost of \nNZ$600 million (approx. US$420 million). However, in \n2013, it was announced that the project had been put \non hold. This remains the case at time of writing. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ In 2016, it was announced that New Zealand is \nphasing out all coal-fired power generation, with \nGenesis Energy advising it will permanently shut \nits last two coal-burning generators by December \n2018 amid ample supplies of cheaper renewable \nenergy generation and subdued demand. The New \n\nZealand Commerce Commission announced that \nTranspower plans to invest around NZ$5 billion \n(approx. US$3.5 billion) in critical infrastructure \nupgrades.\n\n■■ In the electricity retail sector, a report released \nby the Electricity Authority, shows that small and \nmedium sized electricity companies are chipping \naway at the market dominance long enjoyed by giants \nsuch as Meridian Energy and Contact. The Electricity \nAuthority statistics show smaller companies have \nquadrupled their market share since 2009. In 2016, \nsmall and medium-sized retailers were recorded as \nserving over 195,000 residential customers, which is \nfour times higher than it was in 2009. \n\n■■ In 2017, the New Zealand Government announced it had \nearmarked NZ$3.5 million (approx. US$2.45 million) \nto fund 15 projects for its Low Emission Vehicles \nContestable Fund.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act 2000 was the \nfirst legislative effort to promote renewable energy \nin New Zealand. The Act established the Energy \nEfficiency and Conservation Authority which produces \nregular reports on New Zealand’s energy use and \nenergy targets. The Act largely sets out the ambit of \nthe Authority’s reporting requirements. \n\n■■ The National Policy Statement for Renewable \nElectricity Generation 2011 is the main government \npolicy paper coordinating the renewable energy drive \nthroughout New Zealand. The paper’s main objective \nis to “recognise the national significance of renewable \nelectricity generation activities by providing for the \ndevelopment, operation, maintenance and upgrading \nof new and existing renewable electricity generation \nactivities”.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ New Zealand does not have a feed-in tariff scheme \nfor renewable energy generators. Although there are \nno central government incentives to assist consumers \nor businesses in New Zealand to implement solar or \nother onsite renewable generation technologies, \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 81\n\nthere are some local authorities that have initiatives in \nplace to encourage renewable energy generation at a \nresidential level. \n\n■■ The Government has established the Low Emission \nVehicles Contestable Fund as part of a package of \ninitiatives to help stimulate electric vehicle uptake \nand meet the target of 64,000 electric vehicles on \nNew Zealand roads by 2021. \n\n■■ The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, as well \nas the electricity market reforms are perhaps the \ngreatest government incentives for renewable energy \nin New Zealand.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ Hydropower generation has remained relatively steady \nsince 1993. The only major hydropower project since \nthen was the completion of the second Manapouri \ntailrace tunnel in 2002, increasing the station from \n585MW to 750MW. Further expansion of hydropower \ngeneration is constrained because of community \nconcerns over environmental impacts and loss of \namenity values, as well as competing demands for \nwater resources. \n\n■■ Future electricity generation investment is likely to be \nin a mix of generating plants, predominantly wind and \ngeothermal, with gas-fuelled plants for peaking and \n\n\n\n82 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\ndry-year support. The 2010 streamlining of resource \nmanagement legislation is intended to assist the \ndevelopment of new generation plant.\n\n■■ In addition to the 19 wind farms that are either \noperating or under construction, there are about \n13 projects that have been ‘consented’. However, \nnot all projects with ‘consent’ will be built. \nMany are currently on hold as developers wait for \ndemand to increase enough to make the wind farm \ncommercially viable.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Overseas Investment Act 2005 is the main \nlegislative instrument governing foreign investment in \nNew Zealand. It established the Overseas Investment \nOffice, which coordinates foreign investment in \nNew Zealand. Under the Act, a non-resident only \nrequires the Office’s approval in three circumstances if:\n\n – investing more than NZ$100 million (approx. \nUS$70 million) to establish a business;\n\n – planning to purchase an equity share of greater than \n25% in a New Zealand company worth more than \nNZ$10 million (approx. US$7 million); or\n\n – investing in land or an interest in land that is \n“sensitive land”. Sensitive land includes land that \nis the foreshore or seabed, the bed of a lake, \nland on islands (other than the North Island and \nSouth Island) and non-urban land that exceeds five \nhectares.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ New Zealand signed the Paris Agreement on  \n22 April 2016, and ratified the agreement on \n4 October 2016. New Zealand has committed to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below \n2005 levels by 2030. New Zealand also has a longer \nterm target of reducing emissions to 50% below \n1990 levels by 2050.\n\n■■ The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme is \nthe Government’s principal policy response to \nclimate change. It supports global efforts to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions while maintaining economic \nproductivity. The scheme puts a price on greenhouse \ngas emissions, and provides an incentive for people to \nreduce emissions and plant forests to absorb carbon \ndioxide. Certain sectors are required to acquire and \nsurrender emission units to account for their direct \ngreenhouse gas emissions or the emissions associated \nwith their products. An emission unit represents one \nmetric tonne of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of \nany other greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide equivalent). \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 83\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■

emerged as a sovereign State out of the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. Since \nindependence, Pakistan has shown significant economic progress despite facing regional tensions, terrorism \nand territorial disputes, especially with neighbouring India. Pakistan holds much economic potential as \nthe world’s sixth most populous country, strategically placed in the intercept between South, Central and \nWestern Asia. Despite strong economic expansion in the 2000s, the industrial production sector in Pakistan \nfaces chronic energy shortages. Recently, Pakistan launched the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, in \ncollaboration with the Government of the Peoples’ Republic of China, to meet the energy challenges faced by \nthe country and develop major transportation infrastructure. \n\nPAKISTAN\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 85\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Pakistan has suffered major power shortages in recent \nyears. Electricity generation remains a top priority. \nThe country remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and \nimports oil from neighbouring countries. Under the \nChina Pakistan Economic Corridor program, Pakistan \nproposes to add 10,400MW of energy capacity to \nmeet its energy shortages. At present approximately \n33% of the population does not have access to \nelectricity. \n\n■■ Pakistan’s generation capacity has risen in recent \nyears. From July 2015 to March 2016, Pakistan \ngenerated 73,209GWh of electricity. Of this, \n45,252GWh (62%) was from thermal sources, \n24,544GWh (34%) from hydropower and 3,078GWh \n(4%) from nuclear power.\n\n■■ The electricity industry is regulated by the National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), which \nwas established in 1997. NEPRA is responsible for \nsetting tariffs, issuing licenses, and transmitting and \ndistributing power.\n\n■■ The average retail rate of electricity sits at around \nUS$0.07 per unit, which is cheap by global standards.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ Primarily, the Electricity Act 1910, as well as the rules \nand bylaws made under that Act, govern the legislative \nframework of the electricity sector in Pakistan. \nThe Electricity Act has been amended a number of \ntimes since 1910, including to define renewable \nenergy, and impose heavy criminal sanctions for \nelectricity theft.\n\n■■ The Regulation of Generation, Transmission and \nDistribution of Electric Power Act 1997 established \nNEPRA to oversee the generation, transmission \nand distribution of electricity.\n\nGeneration, transmission, and distribution \n\n■■ Electricity is generated across the country by \nnumerous power station operators. There are \ntwo coal stations and 23 thermal power stations, \nthe biggest (in terms of capacity) being the Kot Addu \npower plant in Punjab and Hub Power Co Ltd’s \n\nHub power plant outside Karachi. Independent \nPower Producers account for around 30% of energy \nproduction. The two key players are the public Water \nand Power Development Authority and the private \nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation. \n\n■■ National Transmission and Dispatch Company, a \ngovernment-owned company, manages the majority \nof transmission infrastructure in the country. Two \ngrids provide electricity transmission across Pakistan. \nThe larger national grid services the majority of \nthe country, while the largest and most populous \ncity, Karachi, has its own dedicated grid. The two \ngrids are interconnected but operated separately. \nThe distribution functions are managed by various \ngovernment-owned distribution companies operating \nacross the country. \n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Board exists \nto facilitate and promote a greater market share \nfor renewable energy in Pakistan. Hydropower is \nalready a major contributor to Pakistan’s energy \nsector. Pakistan also has good potential for wind and \nsolar. The Alternative Energy Development Board, \nin collaboration with the World Bank, has conducted \nextensive wind and solar mapping projects. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower exists as a major established form of \npower generation in Pakistan. Hydropower accounts \nfor 34% of all electricity generated in the country. \nAccording to the World Energy Council, Pakistan \ncurrently has an installed hydropower capacity of \n7.26GW.\n\n■■ The Nelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (969MW), \nwhich commenced construction in 2008, is near \ncompletion. The Water and Power Development \nAuthority has indicated the project will be ready by \nFebruary 2018.\n\n■■ Work has recently started on two major hydropower \nprojects: Diamer Basha Dam (4,500MW) and \nDasu Hydropower Project (4,320MW). The Dasu \nHydropower Project is funded by the World Bank \n\n\n\n86 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nand is expected to be completed in 2023. Civil works \nrelated to the first stage of the Dasu project (worth \napprox. US$1.72 billion) were awarded to a Chinese \nfirm in March 2017. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ There are currently 27 wind power projects either in \noperation or at various stages of development, with a \ncumulative capacity of 1,347.4MW. Of these, six have \ncommenced commercial operation, with a combined \ncapacity of 308.2MW. \n\n■■ Pakistan’s Planning, Development and Reforms \nMinistry has announced plans to lift the country’s wind \npower capacity to more than 3,500MW by the end \nof 2018. Construction of three wind power projects \n(totalling 200MW) has commenced under the auspices \nof the China Pakistan Economic Corridor program. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Pakistan has a high solar potential, with an average of \neight to 10 hours of sunlight per day.\n\n■■ After World Bank scoping studies, it was suggested \nthat photovoltaic power systems could be a \ncompetitive alternative in powering small appliances \n\nin remote areas. Photovoltaic systems present a \nsignificant opportunity to provide power to large \nsectors of the population who live off-grid. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Pakistan does not currently produce electricity from \ngeothermal sources, however early assessments \nindicate a potential of approximately 80,000MW.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ There are currently four operational sugar mills \ngenerating biomass energy, and a further nine other \nmills in various stages of planning and construction. \n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Pakistan does not currently have any operational \ntidal power capacity. Research and feasibility studies \ncommenced in 2013 with a view to building a 10MW \ntidal power facility at Sonmiani Bay in Balochistan. \nFuture potential will likely focus on creek systems of \nthe Indus delta in Sindh.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 87\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ A mix of commercial and regulatory issues is \npresenting a barrier to investment in the renewables \nindustry. Small-scale projects are hindered by tariff \nprocedures despite efforts by the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Board to minimise red-tape. \n\n■■ While successful steps have been taken to develop a \nlocal renewables industry, chiefly led by hydropower, \nthere are continuing security and profitability \nconcerns in respect of investment into Pakistan’s \nrenewables sector. \n\n■■ The Pakistan Government is working with foreign \ndonors to increase its renewables capacity. In 2016, \nthe Government signed a US$30 million agreement \nwith the United States’ Government to generate \n3,000MW of renewable energy. Germany and Iran are \nalso reportedly negotiating energy agreements with \nPakistan. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Board Act 2010 \nwhich established a board of the same name, is \nresponsible for the implementation of various policies, \nprogrammes and projects related to alternative or \nrenewable energy technologies. In 2006, the Board \nreleased a policy paper that focusses on hydropower, \nwind and solar. \n\n■■ The Board has released policies on biomass \nproduction and a revised financing scheme designed \nto significantly streamline the approval process for \nrenewable energy projects.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The Government has implemented trade policies to \nstimulate the renewables sector, including removing \nimport duties on key components, value added tax \nexceptions on solar home system components and \nminimising non-renewable energy subsidies. \n\n■■ NEPRA has recently published new solar feed-in tariff \nrates for public comment. The proposed rates stand \nat an average of US$0.097 per kWh. \n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Board \nhas recommended a waiver of import duties on \nphotovoltaic panels and assembled solar home systems \nand lanterns, though customs levies remain at 15% and \n30 to 35% respectively.\n\n■■ Under the Power Policy 2015, the following incentives \nhave been offered by the Government of Pakistan for \npower generation projects: \n\n – exemption from income tax;\n\n – sponsors would be allowed to import plant \nand equipment not manufactured locally at a \nconcessionary customs duty rate of 5%;\n\n – companies will be completely exempted from the \npayment of income tax, including turnover rate tax \nand withholding tax on imports; and\n\n – repatriation of equity along with dividends is \nfreely allowed subject to the prescribed rules and \nregulations.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ Pakistan hosts over 75 hydropower generation \nstations, the biggest being the Tarbella and Managala \ndams and the Ghazi-Barotha hydropower project. \nIn December 2016, Pakistan began construction of \nthe 84MW Matiltan hydropower project, which is \nexpected to help provide uninterrupted power supply \nto one million people in the Swat region.\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Board is \ncurrently involved in 28 different solar power projects \nwith a combined capacity of 956.52MW. Of those, \none is currently commercially operative and a further \nthree are under construction. \n\n■■ The 1,000MW Quaid e Azam Solar Park has been \nconstructed in Bahawalpur. The plant is producing \nan average of 169GWh against an initial target of \n153GWh.\n\n■■ Shanghai Electric Power was given domestic approval \nto acquire a 61.4% stake in Pakistan’s K-Electric for \napproximately US$1.7 billion. The deal is believed to \nbe the biggest public sector acquisition in Pakistan and \nunderpins the close infrastructure ties between Beijing \nand Karachi. \n\n\n\n88 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Foreign direct investments for the period July 2016 \nto January 2017 stands at just over US$1.1 billion out \nof which US$245.3 million was in the power sector. \nThe Pakistani Government is actively encouraging \nforeign investment, especially in the energy sector. \nWith a strategy to increase growth to 7 to 8%, \nthe Government has in part looked to establish \nspecial economic zones to enhance the nation’s \ncompetiveness.\n\n■■ The Investment Policy 2013 allows investment in all \nsectors of the economy, unless specifically prohibited \nor restricted for reasons of national security and \npublic safety. There is no minimum requirement \nfor the amount of foreign equity investment in any \nsector. Under the 2013 Policy, foreign investors are \ngranted the same status as that of local and domestic \ninvestors, and all facilities available to local and \ndomestic investors are extended to foreign investors \non an equal basis. There is no upper limit on the share \nof foreign equity allowed, except in specific sectors, \nincluding airlines, banking, agriculture and media.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Pakistan ratified the Paris Agreement on \n10 November 2016. \n\n■■ Pakistan’s Intended Nationally Determined \nContribution was submitted in November 2015, and \nis grounded in the country’s ‘Vision 2025’ strategic \nplan for development. Pakistan noted the need for \ninternational financing, technology development and \ntransfer, and capacity building, however it did not \nappear to set a specific carbon reduction target. \n\n■■ At the Paris Conference in December 2015, Pakistan’s \nMinister for Climate Change called for ‘undivided focus’ \nand a holistic approach to tackling climate change.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 89\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Alternative Energy Development Board – www.aedb.org/ \n\n■■ Pakistan Council of Renewable Energy Technologies – www.pcret.gov.pk/ \n\n■■ National Electric Power Regulatory Authority – www.nepra.org.pk/\n\n■■ National Transmission & Dispatch Company – www.ntdc.com.pk/\n\n■■ Private Power Investment Board – www.ppib.gov.pk/ \n\n■■ Board of Investment – www.boi.gov.pk/ \n\n■■ Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power (Pvt.)

PNG was subject to fierce fighting during World War Two. After the war, Australia administered \nPNG until the country gained its independence in 1975. PNG is one of the most culturally diverse countries \nin the world with around 848 languages in the country. It is also one of the most non-urbanised countries in \nthe world, with over 80% of its people living in rural areas. In recent years, the economy has been boosted \nby mining and resource sector investments. Despite this, many people live in extreme poverty, with about \none-third of the population living on less than US$1.25 per day. \n\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA\n\n90 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 91\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In 2010 (the latest found reliable data), installed \nelectricity capacity was 582MW. Of this amount:\n\n – 39.5% was from hydropower;\n\n – 37.3% from diesel generators;\n\n – 14.1% from natural gas; and\n\n – 9.1% from geothermal. \n\n■■ A draft renewable energy policy report from the PNG \nGovernment also estimates a similar break-down in \npower sources. \n\n■■ The PNG National Statistical Office has estimated \nthat just 12% of PNG’s households have access to \nelectricity. Accordingly, one of the country’s goals in \nits Strategic Development Plan 2010-30 is to increase \nelectricity access to 21% of the population by 2020, \nand to 70% by 2030. As yet, there is no clear plan on \nhow this is to be achieved. \n\n■■ Over two-thirds of new electricity demand is likely to \narise beyond PNG’s current or future electricity grid. \nMeeting this will therefore require substantial new \npower generation resources. \n\n■■ PNG is a net energy exporter, with an estimated \n65% of energy produced consumed locally, with the \nremaining 35% being exported overseas (chiefly, \nnatural gas).  \n\nMarket regulators and generators\n\n■■ PNG Power Limited (PPL) is the peak power \nauthority in PNG, and is responsible for the \ngeneration, transmission, distribution and retail of \nelectricity. PPL provides regulatory oversight to \nactivities such as certifying electrical equipment, \nproviding advisory services and approving electrical \nlicenses. PNG Forests, Hanjung Power, New Britain \nPalm Oil (now Sime Darby), Western Power (part \nof PNG Sustainable Ltd) and Pacific Energy are also \nnotable utilities which sell power to PPL.\n\n■■ PPL is responsible for 17 ‘electricity centres’ \nthroughout PNG. Three of these centres are \nhydropower schemes with over 10MW capacity, \nwhile the other 14 centres are thermal-based.\n\n■■ In its draft renewable energy policy, the PNG \nGovernment noted that “PPL assets have almost \nsurpassed their life time [and] there is a severe and \ncritical power generation shortage experienced \nthroughout the country”.\n\n■■ PPL works alongside the Department of Petroleum \nand Energy, the Department of Environment and \nConservation and the Independent Consumer and \nCompetition Commission to regulate and coordinate \nthe energy sector. \n\nDistribution and transmission\n\n■■ PNG does not have a national grid system. Instead, \nthe country is powered by three urban grids and \n14 provincial systems. The three urban grids are the \nPort Moresby, Ramu and Gazelle Peninsula Systems. \n\n■■ The reliability of the existing grids is poor due \nto difficult terrain, high rainfall, vandalism and an \nunderdeveloped road network. Transmission and \ndistribution losses are around 20%.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ PNG has enormous untapped reserves of renewable \nenergy. In 2013, Bloomberg New Energy Finance \nranked the country in the top 10 for potential \nrenewable resources, with only 2% of an estimated \n2.5GW exploited. The PNG Government, in its draft \nrenewable energy sector policy report, estimated \nthe country currently has 272MW of renewables \ncapacity. However, it noted the “conventional sources \nof thermal and the current hydropower sources are \nnow aging” and that the 272MW figure is perhaps \nambitious given that two major hydropower facilities \nat Ramu and Rouna are no longer operating at full \ncapacity. Further, most of the renewable resources are \nin remote locations, where there is limited demand \nand exploitation is not straightforward.\n\n■■ PNG’s Strategic Development Plan 2010-30 estimates \nthat installed capacity in the period to 2030 will need \nto increase from 500MW to 1,970MW to reach \ngrowing energy needs. Hydropower is to contribute \nthe most, growing from an (already substantial) \n215MW to 1,140MW. Diesel use in the period is \nexpected to fall from 160MW to 30MW. Other \n\n\n\n92 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nrenewables, mainly geothermal, but also solar, wind, \nbiomass and biogass, are expected to grow to 380MW \n(about 20% of total capacity).\n\n■■ Recently, it has been the private sector largely driving \nrenewable energy use. Such examples include the palm \noil industry using wastes for electricity production, \nthe coffee industry using wood-burning driers and \na number of sugar mills proposing to use wood for \ncombustion in bagasse boilers, designed to increase \ntheir energy production. Several thousand new solar \nhome lighting systems are expected to be installed \nin rural PNG each year, generally through private \ninitiatives. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower is the largest source of electricity in \nPNG. There is also significant potential growth. \nThe World Bank estimated a gross theoretical \nhydropower potential for PNG at 175TWh per year. \nPNG currently has nine large hydrological drainage \nbasins, including the Sepik, Fly, Purari and Markham \ncatchments.  \n\n■■ Transmission of hydropower sources to population \ncentres is a problem in PNG, especially considering \nthe rugged terrain of much of the country. Small \nhydropower dams have accordingly received some \nattention. A 2004 study found that there may have \nbeen as many as 200 small hydropower systems \ninstalled in rural PNG between 1960 and 2004, \nof which perhaps 20 to 25% are still functioning. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ It is believed that there has been no thorough \nassessment of wind energy potential in PNG since the \n1970s. A pilot wind energy project has been installed \nin the Duke of York islands to power the local hospital \nand other facilities. This was jointly funded by the \nPNG and Chinese Governments. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Solar energy is among the largest potential renewable \nenergy sources in PNG. Average insolation in most of \nthe country is 400 to 800W/m2, with 4.5 to 8 sunshine \nhours a day. \n\n■■ Stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems have been \ntouted as an answer to the country’s heavy reliance \non diesel and kerosene lamps for lighting. Solar energy \nhas spread gradually in PNG over the past 30 years, \nwith small independent solar systems marketed by \nprivate suppliers and used mainly for lighting and \ncommunications. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ The Geothermal Energy Association estimates PNG’s \ngeothermal potential at 21.92TWh. The association \nalso categorises the country as an economy that \ncould, in theory, meet all its electricity needs well into \nthe future from geothermal sources alone.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ A 2013 International Renewable Energy Agency report \nnoted that despite two-thirds of PNG being covered \nin forest, most of the land is inaccessible or unsuitable \nfor biomass due to regular erosion and flooding. The \nreport also notes the missed opportunity to capitalise \non the country’s logging industry and developing \nbiomass facilities from various biproducts. \n\n■■ Traditional biomass consumption (generally burning \nwood) is estimated to have accounted for over 50% of \nPNG’s national energy consumption in 2010, though \nthere have been no recent surveys to document \nits use. \n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ There is very limited knowledge of PNG’s potential \nfor ocean thermal energy, tidal energy or wave \nenergy. Near Port Moresby, the tidal range is \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 93\n\n2.7 metres, compared to 1.1 to 1.6 metres in most \nof the country. Reportedly, there is a 6 metre range \nin parts of the Torres Strait. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ The Government’s strategic plan is seeking to \nphase-out diesel and basic biomass use, in favour \nof sources like solar whilst also looking towards \ndeveloping further hydro facilities, likely through \nsmall-scale plants that do not require extensive \ntransmission infrastructure.\n\n■■ The Government itself recognises the need to \nupgrade aging infrastructure generation and \ntransmission infrastructure which is inhibiting the \ncapacity of the country’s existing hydropower \ndams and thermal power plants. It appears \nlikely the Government’s preference is to update \ncurrent infrastructure ahead of developing new \ninfrastructure, in addition to developing local \nexpertise to maintain more remote facilities. \n\n■■ Other challenges for the nation’s electricity sector \ninclude its rugged terrain, high rainfall, dispersed \nand isolated populations, and lack of project finance. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\nPolicy statements\n\n■■ The Energy Division (part of the Department of \nPetroleum and Energy) is responsible for renewable \nenergy and electricity policy. Despite numerous \ndraft policies, no formal renewables policy has been \nadopted.\n\n■■ Key draft policies include the National Energy \nPolicy, Rural Electrification Policy and Strategy, \nGeothermal Energy Policy, Electricity Industry \nPolicy and Renewable Energy Policy (discussed \nthroughout). The Strategic Development Plan \n2010-30 also addresses energy issues. \n\nLaws\n\n■■ PNG does not have a specific renewable energy law. \nGeneric electricity laws include the: \n\n – Electricity Supply Act, which states the powers of \nthe Minister for Energy for generation, supply \nand extension of electricity from those power \nfacilities built with government funds;\n\n – Electricity Industry Act, which states the functions \nand powers of PPL; and,\n\n – Independent Consumer and Competition Act, \nregulating electricity, petroleum and pricing.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ PNG currently has limited incentive programs such \nas feed-in tariffs, low-cost loans, reduced import \nduties or reduced taxes for the production of \nrenewable energy technologies. The Government \nincentive programs largely support the \nmanufacturing and agricultural industry.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Karimui hydropower dam in Chimbu is \nexpected to commence construction in 2017 and be \ncompleted by 2023. Once in operation, the facility \nwill generate 1,800MW of electricity, making it the \nlargest hydropower station in the country. \n\n■■ The Ramu System Power Development Master Plan \nand Lae Area Distribution Network Improvement \nProject is in its final stages of planning. This \nhas involved research, study, assessment and \nformulation by PPL and the Japan International \nCooperation Agency. \n\n■■ The Edevu hydropower plant is being constructed \nby PNG Hydro Development Ltd and will have a \ncapacity of 50MW. \n\n\n\n94 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Investment Promotion Authority was \nestablished to provide assistance to foreign \ninvestors and promote investment in PNG. \nThe Authority provides services such as business \nregistration, regulation and certification, and also \noffers information on export opportunities to \ninternational markets. \n\n■■ After the completion of a major liquefied natural \ngas project in 2014, foreign investment in PNG \nhas slowed. Barriers to foreign investment include \nlack of equipment, the State’s monopolies, political \ninstability and security issues. \n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ PNG ratified the Paris Agreement on \n21 September 2016 and committed to reduce \nemissions from land use change and forestry. PNG \nintends to reduce deforestation and promote \nforest conservation and sustainable management of \nits forests. As there is a growth in fuel use, PNG \nhas also stated its intention to reduce fossil fuel \nemissions in the electricity generation sector by \ntransitioning to renewable energy. \n\n■■ PNG has very low absolute emissions and relatively \nlow per capita emissions. The country, however, \nis still committed to reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n\n\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Department of Petroleum and Energy – http://elseti.org/international/departments-of-energy/australia-and-oceania/\ngovernment-of-papua-new-guinea-department-of-petroleum-energy.html \n\n■■ Investment Promotion Authority: Papua New Guinea – https://www.ipa.gov.pg/\n\n■■ Renewable Energy Sector Development Policy in PNG, available on Google (PDF only)\n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ IRENA, Pacific Lighthouses, Renewable energy opportunities and challenges in the Pacific Islands region, accessed at: \nhttps://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Papua%20New%20Guinea.pdf\n\n■■ Reegle, Independent State of Papua New Guinea, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/policy-and-regulatory-overviews/PG\n\n■■ Sylver Yagi, Loop, Karimui hydro to be largest in PNG, accessed at: http://www.looppng.com/content/karimui-hydro-\nbe-largest-png \n\n■■ Promoting Energy Efficiency in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, accessed at: http://www.ee-pacific.net/index.php/\ndatabase/country-information/papua-new-guinea\n\n■■ Asian Development Bank, Energy Sector Assessment, accessed at: https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-\ndocuments/CAPE-PNG-6-Energy-Sector-Assessment.pdf\n\n■■ Papua New Guinea Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) Under the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (National Climate Action Plan), Papua New Guinea, accessed at: http://www4.unfccc.int/\nndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Papua%20New%20Guinea%20First/PNG_INDC%20to%20the%20UNFCCC.pdf\n\n■■ Oxford Business Group, Expanding the role of renewable energy in PNG, accessed at: \nhttps://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/expanding-role-renewable-energy-png\n\n■■ ANZ, PNG’s electricity generation challenge: Power to the people, power to the economy, accessed at: \nhttps://bluenotes.anz.com/posts/2015/08/pngs-electricity-generation-challenge/\n\n■■ PNG Power Ltd, Projects, accessed at http://www.pngpower.com.pg/projects\n\n■■ Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Scaling up Financing to Expand the Renewables Portfolio, accessed at: \nhttp://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2013/scalingupfinancingtoexpandrenewables/2bnef_20130409parisiea.pdf \n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 95\n\nhttp://elseti.org/international/departments-of-energy/australia-and-oceania/government-of-papua-new-guinea-department-of-petroleum-energy.html\nhttp://elseti.org/international/departments-of-energy/australia-and-oceania/government-of-papua-new-guinea-department-of-petroleum-energy.html\nhttps://www.ipa.gov.pg/\nhttps://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Papua New Guinea.pdf\nhttp://www.reegle.info/policy-and-regulatory-overviews/PG\nhttp://www.looppng.com/content/karimui-hydro-be-largest-png\nhttp://www.looppng.com/content/karimui-hydro-be-largest-png\nhttp://www.ee-pacific.net/index.php/database/country-information/papua-new-guinea\nhttp://www.ee-pacific.net/index.php/database/country-information/papua-new-guinea\nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/CAPE-PNG-6-Energy-Sector-Assessment.pdf\nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/CAPE-PNG-6-Energy-Sector-Assessment.pdf\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Papua New Guinea First/PNG_INDC to the UNFCCC.pdf\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Papua New Guinea First/PNG_INDC to the UNFCCC.pdf\nhttps://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/expanding-role-renewable-energy-png\nhttps://bluenotes.anz.com/posts/2015/08/pngs-electricity-generation-challenge/\nhttp://www.pngpower.com.pg/projects\nhttp://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2013/scalingupfinancingtoexpandrenewables/2bnef_20130409parisiea.pdf\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Mixed legal system of civil, common, Islamic and customary law\n\nLanguage: Filipino and English (official)\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 99 of 190 (no change) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 57 of 138 (down 10 rankings) \n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 58 of 180 (up 12 rankings) \n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 101 of 176 (down 3 rankings rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 115 of 188 (up 2 rankings)\n\nPopulation: 100.7 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$3,550\n\nPROFILE\n\nRepublic of the Philippines (the Philippines) is an archipelagic nation comprising 7,107 islands. The country \nis a former Spanish colony and was also under American rule for a period in the early 20th century. Following \nJapanese occupation during World War Two, the Philippines gained its independence in 1946. Since then, \nthe country has had periods of political stability intermingled with ‘people power’ movements to overthrow \npresidents in 1986 and 2001. While the Philippine economy has continued on its growth trajectory under \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, some international commentators are concerned about unpredictable policy \nmaking. Tensions with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea appear to be receding, with \nPresident Duterte adopting a more conciliatory approach. \n\nTHE PHILIPPINES\n\n96 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 97\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The electricity market in the Philippines is divided \ninto three grids: Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. \n\n■■ The primary sources of electricity in the Philippines \nare coal (46%) and natural gas (24%), with \ngeothermal (14%) and hydropower energy (7%) \nthe most significant renewable energy sources. \n\n■■ Electricity in the Philippines is said to be the third \nmost expensive in Asia, with an average retail rate \nacross the country of US$0.15 per kWh.\n\n■■ As of 2016, around 11 million people do not have \nelectricity in the Philippines. Dwellings with an \nelectricity connection experience frequent power \nfluctuations. In 2014, then President Benigno Aquino \nrequested emergency powers from the Philippine \nCongress to lease additional capacity and take \nmeasures to prevent outages in Luzon, the largest \nof the three grids.\n\n■■ The electricity generation capacity of the country is \nexpected to increase significantly from 20,055MW \nin 2016 to 25,800MW in 2030. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 \n(EPIRA) sought to comprehensively restructure \nthe industry from “a vertically integrated, \nextensively publicly-owned utility business, [to an] \nindustry [which] was envisioned to be broken down \ninto its main components with a deregulated and \neffectively privatised generation and supply sectors”.\n\n■■ The EPIRA established the Energy Regulatory \nCommission, which regulates the Filipino energy \nsector and has quasi-judicial functions.\n\n■■ While the transmission and distribution sectors \nremain regulated, the generation sector has \nbeen fully deregulated. Generation prices are \nlargely governed by market forces or settled on \na commercial basis.\n\nGeneration\n\n■■ Following the privatisation of generation assets held \nby the National Power Corporation, the generation \nsector is becoming more competitive as barriers to \nentry have been reduced and more private sector \ninvestors have entered the market.\n\n■■ The Energy Regulatory Commission regulates \npower generation. Interested parties must receive a \ncertificate of compliance with EPIRA standards, as \nwell as other health, safety and environmental laws \nfrom the relevant agencies. \n\nDistribution\n\n■■ A number of bodies distribute electricity \nthroughout the Philippines, including investor-\nowned utilities such as the Manila Electric Company \n(Meralco), local government-owned utilities and \nconsumer-owned electricity cooperatives. \n\nTransmission\n\n■■ The transmission assets held by the National Power \nCorporation were transferred by EPIRA to the \nNational Transmission Corporation. The operation, \nmaintenance and upgrade of the assets, on the \nother hand, was privatised by way of concession \ncontract undertaken by the Power Sector Assets \nand Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM).\n\n■■ PSALM then awarded the 25-year concession \ncontract to the National Grid Corporation of \nthe Philippines. As concessionaire, the National \nGrid Corporation is required to prepare the \nTransmission Development Plan and is authorised \nto collect wheeling charges and other fees, as \napproved by the Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nReforms\n\n■■ There have been significant reforms in the industry \nfollowing the implementation of EPIRA including:\n\n – privatisation of more than 85% of the National \nPower Corporation’s generation assets and \nIndependent Power Producer’s capacities in \nLuzon, and ongoing privatisation of assets and \ncapacities in Visayas and Mindanao;\n\n – privatisation of the operation and maintenance of \nthe transmission assets;\n\n – commercial operation of the Wholesale \nElectricity Spot Market in Luzon and Visayas, \nas well as trial operations in Mindanao; and\n\n – unbundling of electricity rates to indicate \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, metering \nand ancillary services.\n\n\n\n98 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The Philippine Government’s goals for the \nrenewable energy sector, as set out in the National \nRenewable Energy Program, include:\n\n – increasing renewable energy-based capacity to \n15.304GW by 2030, which will constitute 35% of \nthe Philippines’ total energy capacity;\n\n – becoming the number one geothermal energy \nproducer in the world (currently second);\n\n – becoming the number one wind energy producer \nin Southeast Asia; and\n\n – expanding the contribution of biomass, solar and \nocean energy by 131MW.\n\n■■ The latest statistics released by the Department of \nEnergy as of June 2016 indicate renewable sources \nconstitute 34.3% of total energy production. \nA Department of Energy announcement from \nJanuary 2016 suggests that the installed capacity of \nrenewable projects may reach 20GW by 2030.\n\n■■ Despite a relatively advanced renewable energy \ncontribution, the Philippines has significant potential \nfor further clean energy development. To this end, \nthe Philippine Congress passed the Renewable Energy \nAct of 2008. \n\n■■ In late May 2013, the Department of Energy \nissued guidelines on the selection and awarding of \ncertificates for renewable energy projects. The \nDepartment of Energy has announced that it will \ncontinue the ‘first come, first served’ approach. \nUnder the guidelines, upon a project being declared \ncommercially viable, a developer must compete with \nother project proponents in building a renewable \nenergy facility before being awarded a feed-in tariff.\n\n■■ With the Department of Energy’s guarantee of \ncurrent feed-in tariff rates for 20 years, several \nsolar and wind power projects have commenced \ncommercial operations over the last two years \nwhile hydropower projects advance in various \nstages of development.\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower is a significant energy source in the \nPhilippines. As at June 2016, there was 3,609MW \ninstalled, which represents 18% of the Philippines’ \ntotal energy capacity. \n\n■■ According to the Department of Energy, there are \ncurrently 135 hydropower plants, including 22 large \nhydropower plants in the country.\n\n■■ Estimated potential from small hydropower is \napproximately 1.3GW.\n\n■■ Major hydropower sites include Kalayaan Pumped \nStorage Power Plant (739.2MW), San Roque \n(411MW) and Magat (360MW). \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ The Philippines has a theoretical wind generation \ncapacity of 70GW. While there has been a \nsignificant increase in the number of wind power \nprojects over the last few years, the wind industry \nis still underdeveloped and the distance of potential \nsites from population centres presents a challenge.\n\n■■ The currently installed capacity is 427MW, with an \nadditional 1,200MW projected to potentially come \nonline over the next few years. \n\n■■ Despite this underdevelopment, the Department \nof Energy is focusing on wind power to meet \nincreasing energy demand. The Department of \nEnergy’s increased installation target for wind of \n200MW, set under the feed-in tariff system in \nApril 2015, was immediately subscribed. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ While solar energy traditionally comprised a small \npercentage of overall capacity, there has been \nrapid growth in recent years. The total installed \ncapacity, as of June 2016, was 684MW. Solar power \nis expected to contribute 8.7GW by 2030. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 99\n\n■■ The decreasing cost of solar resources, government \nincentives under the feed-in tariff regime and policy \nimperatives, both from climate change and energy \nsecurity perspectives, are expected to continue this \ngrowth trend. \n\n■■ Toward the end of 2016, Meralco – the largest \ndistribution utility in the Philippines – entered into \nlong-term power purchase agreements for solar \nprojects that failed to qualify under the feed-in tariff \nsystem. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Geothermal energy is a major source of renewable \nenergy in the Philippines, with a total installed \ncapacity of about 2GW.\n\n■■ The Philippines is the second largest producer of \ngeothermal energy globally. Major geothermal sites \ninclude Unified Leyte (610.2MW) and Tiwi/MakBan \n(747MW). \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ The Philippines had 233MW of installed biomass \ncapacity in June 2016.\n\n■■ Fuel wood is a dominant energy source in rural \nparts of the country, however this has led to \ndeforestation. Alternative sources, such as bagasse \nfrom sugar cane and rice husk, are being utilised and \nfurther developed as fuel for power projects.\n\n■■ The Philippines has large agriculture, forestry \nand livestock industries, which results in the \nconsumption of biomass energy widely throughout \nthe country.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Ocean energy is seen as a major potential energy \nsource in the Philippines. As at 31 January 2016, \na number of projects have received approval \nsubject to on-going study and permits, including \nthe Cabangan Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion \nproject. Despite announcing the Cabangan project \nin 2011, the Department of Energy is yet to fix \na feed-in tariff rate for ocean energy, which has \ncaused delays.\n\n■■ H&WB Asia Pacific (Pte. Ltd.) Corp. and French \nenergy development firm Sabella SAS are reportedly \ninterested in establishing Southeast Asia’s first \nocean tidal power plant project in the Philippines in \nthe first half of 2017.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE POWER \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ In late 2016, the National Bureau of Investigation \nreceived allegations of bidding irregularities at the \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. President Duterte \ncalled for several senior officials to resign and \nrequested that Congress abolish the Commission. \nThe investigation and political response are ongoing.\n\n■■ The Energy Regulatory Commission, in a \nMarch 2015 resolution, expanded the capacity for \nthe solar feed-in tariff from 50MW to 500MW. \nThe resolution fostered an immediate growth in \nsolar projects.\n\n■■ The Philippines’ archipelagic geography makes for a \ncostly transmission and distribution of electricity. \nAnalysts have called for increased renewable energy \nin remote areas as a cheaper, long-term alternative \nto diesel-run plants. However, the 40% foreign \nownership limit for renewable energy projects \nand the absence of regulatory standardisation \nbeyond the feed-in tariff regime are impediments \nto renewable energy electrification in these more \nremote areas of the country.\n\n■■ Some environmental groups have criticised the \nGovernment for continuing to commission coal \nplants, despite advocating renewable energy as the \ncountry’s energy priority. Department of Energy \nfigures show that there are currently 23 coal-fired \npower plants in the pipeline.\n\n■■ The Department of Energy has laid down a \nnew energy mix that will not put a limit on any \ntechnology to foster competition so that the \ncountry will have adequate and reliable electricity \nsupply moving forward.\n\n\n\n100 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS – OTHER ELEMENTS\n\n■■ The Renewable Energy Act of 2008 seeks to \naccelerate the exploration and development \nof renewable energy sources and increase the \nutilisation of renewable energy. The Department of \nEnergy is the lead agency mandated to implement \nthe Act’s objectives.\n\n■■ The Act requires the Department of Energy to \nestablish a Renewable Energy Market, which is \noperated under the Wholesale Electricity Spot \nMarket. \n\n■■ The Renewable Energy Market facilitates the \ntrading of renewable energy certificates to ensure \ncompliance with the Renewable Portfolio Standard. \nThis standard requires electricity suppliers to \nsource a minimum amount of energy from “eligible \nrenewable sources”. \n\n■■ The Act also created the National Renewable \nEnergy Board. Its functions include recommending \nspecific actions to implement the National \nRenewable Energy Plan. The plan sets targets for \nrenewable energy capacity (as outlined above) and \naims to provide a comprehensive approach for \ndevelopment of renewable resources. \n\n■■ The Act also established a Renewable Energy Trust \nFund to enhance the development and greater \nutilisation of renewable energy, to be administered \nby the Department of Energy as a special account in \ngovernment financial institutions.\n\n■■ Consumers may choose to source their power from \nrenewable sources (known as the “Green Energy \nOption” under the Act).\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The main incentive for renewable energy developers \nis the feed-in tariff regime. The rates offered for \nwind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy are \nrelatively high by regional standards and second only \nto Japan. \n\n■■ The feed-in tariff also includes priority connections \nto the grid for renewable energy; priority purchase \nand transmission of, and payment for such electricity \nby the grid system operators; and for the National \n\nRenewable Energy Board to recommend for the \nEnergy Regulatory Commission to approve the fixed \ntariff rate.\n\n■■ There are a number of other incentives under \nChapter VII of the Act for investors and developers, \nincluding seven year income tax holidays, low \ncorporate tax rates, duty-free importation of \nmachinery and other tax incentives.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ In May 2016, the World Bank approved US$67 million \nfor renewable energy under the Philippines Renewable \nEnergy Project and the Access to Sustainable Energy \nProject. The latter will be used to introduce solar \npower to remote communities.\n\n■■ The first hydropower project – the Ambuklao \nHydropower Plant – was commissioned in 1956. \nThe facility is now owned and operated by a joint \nventure between SN Power of Norway and Aboitiz \nPower of the Philippines.\n\n■■ Explorations for the Tiwi and MakBan Geothermal \nPower Plant Complex commenced in 1964, with the \nfirst unit in Tiwi commencing operations in 1976. \nThe generation assets are owned by the Aboitiz Group. \n\n■■ North Wind Power Development Corporation \ndeveloped the first commercial wind farm in the \nPhilippines, the 33MW Bangui Bay North wind farm in \nIlocos Norte. The largest wind farm, Burgos, owned \nby First Gen Holdings, is also located in Ilocos Norte \nand generates 150MW. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ In the Philippines 1987 Constitution, foreign \nownership in a number of sectors, including land, \nnatural resources and (implicitly) the renewable \nenergy sector, is limited to 40%. This is seen as a \nmajor limiting factor for foreign investors in the \nrenewable energy sector in the Philippines.\n\n■■ The Foreign Investments Act of 1991, as amended, provides \nfor the regular issuance of a “Foreign Investment \nNegative List”, which limits foreign investment in certain \nindustries. The Department of Finance will review the \nNegative List in May 2017. It was last updated in 2015. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 101\n\n■■ The Board of Investments regulates and promotes \ninvestment in the Philippines. \n\n■■ The Government’s Investment Priorities Plan \nnonetheless recognises renewable energy \ninvestment as a priority investment area.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ The Philippines signed the Paris Agreement on \n21 April 2016 and committed to an Intended \nNational Determined Contribution of 70% \nreduction in carbon emissions by 2030 (relative to \nbusiness as usual levels).\n\n■■ However, the Philippines’ submission to the \nUNFCCC indicated that the target is “conditioned \non the extent of financial resources, including \ntechnology development and transfer, and \ncapacity building, that will be made available to the \nPhilippines”.\n\n■■ The Philippines is yet to ratify the Agreement and \nPresident Duterte recently suggested that the Paris \nAgreement may lead to “stifling” the economic \ngrowth in the Philippines.\n\n\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Department of Energy – http://www.doe.gov.ph/\n\n■■ Energy Regulatory Commission – http://www.erc.gov.ph/ \n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Department of Energy, Renewable Energy Outlook of the Philippines, accessed at: http://www.egnret.ewg.apec.org/\nmeetings/egnret41/[E07]%20Philippines%20EGNRET41.Phil.Country%20Report.pdf\n\n■■ Department of Energy, Philippine Power Statistics, accessed at: https://www.doe.gov.ph/philippine-power-statistics\n\n■■ Ariel D.

However the Korean War \n(1950 – 1953) resulted in an armistice which split the country in two. The division along the 38th parallel \nremains to this day. It was not until 1987, after decades of economic growth, that Korea held its first free and \ndirect presidential election under a revised constitutional structure. Korea is now a highly developed economy \n(Asia’s fourth largest). However, it continues to face a threat from the unpredictable North. The impeachment \nand subsequent trial of Korea’s first female President, Park Geun-hye, was reflective of broader public outrage \nover ‘influence-peddling’ across government as well as the nation’s large, domestic companies (known as the \nchaebols). \n\nREPUBLIC OF KOREA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 103\n\n\n\n104 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Korea is the ninth largest energy consuming nation \nin the world, and despite an abundance of gas and \ncoal reserves, imports are used to satisfy 98% of its \nfossil fuel needs.\n\n■■ In its 2016 Annual Report, the Korea Electric Power \nCorporation (KEPCO) reported that 528,091GWh \nof electricity was generated from the following \nsources: \n\n – coal: 38.7%; \n\n – nuclear: 31.2%;\n\n – liquefied natural gas: 19.1%;\n\n – oil: 6.0%;\n\n – alternative: 4.0%; and\n\n – hydropower: 1.0%.\n\n■■ Korea has a 100% electrification rate. Household \nelectricity prices in Korea are among the cheapest \nin the OECD at around US$0.1346/kWh (as at \n2014).\n\n■■ The Electricity Regulatory Commission (KOREC) \noversees the electricity industry. It is part of \nthe Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electric Utility Act created the Korea Power \nExchange to run the market and power system and \nalso created the Electricity Regulatory Commission. \nOther provisions of the Act include provisions \nregarding safety and Ministerial planning for the \nindustry. \n\n■■ The Electricity Business Law governs the renewable \nenergy sector and allows renewable energy \ngenerators to sell electricity to the grid at a fixed \nprice. The Act also mandates the Ministry of Trade, \nIndustry and Energy to prepare the ‘Basic Plan of \nLong-term Electricity Supply and Demand’, which \noutlines policy directions for the electricity sector. \nThe most recent Basic Plan was announced in 2008 \nand runs to 2022. \n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ Despite efforts to privatise parts of the electricity \nsector in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Korean \nGovernment has retained a 51% interest in KEPCO. \nKEPCO has 10 subsidiaries in Korea and a further \n30 overseas. \n\n■■ KEPCO continues to control 100% of the transmission \nand distribution in the market and 93% of total power \ngeneration.\n\n■■ The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (formerly \nknown as the Ministry of Knowledge Economy), \nthrough its ordinance, plays a central role in regulating \nthe industry under the Electric Utility Act.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Despite a relatively modest goal of 11% renewables \ncontribution by 2035, the Government intends to \ninvest over US$36 billion in renewables by 2020. \nA large tidal power station and offshore wind farms \nnear Jeju Island are two notable projects (see below). \n\n■■ Between 1993 and 2012, the Government spent \nUS$2.6 billion on fostering a domestic market for \nrenewable energy.\n\n■■ On 15 August 2008, the Government announced \nthe Low Carbon and Green Growth strategy, which \nis a plan to reduce carbon emissions and also to \npromote renewable energy, energy efficiency and \nenvironmentally conscious buildings. \n\n■■ The Seoul Metropolitan Government has been active \nin promoting renewable energy. Seoul recently \nannounced the introduction of its own feed-in tariff \nprogram and is also seeking to halt the expansion of \nall nuclear power plants. Korea’s capital accounts for \naround 10% of the country’s electricity consumption.\n\n■■ Between 2021 and 2030, Korea hopes to complete a \nnationwide “Smart Grid”.\n\n■■ A test bed for a Smart Grid has been built on Jeju \nIsland, which was chosen due to its abundant wind \nand solar energy resources. The Government has \nannounced its plans to make Jeju island 100% free of \ncarbon emissions. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 105\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ In its 2016 Annual Report, KEPCO noted that \nhydropower generated 5,796GWh of electricity. \n\n■■ Estimates have been made that the country has a \nsmall-scale hydropower potential of 1.5GW. There \nare significant untapped resources, given that installed \ncapacity is less than 5% of domestic potential. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Korean conglomerates have begun to invest \nsignificantly in offshore wind farms, however most \nwind farm developments to date have been onshore. \nIn 2014, cumulative installed wind power amounted to \n608.5MW. \n\n■■ In 2011, the Government announced a strategy to \nattract US$8.2 billion to develop offshore wind farms \nwith a capacity of 2.5GW by 2019.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ The greatest economic potential for solar thermal is \nin Korea’s southern coastal area.\n\n■■ In 2015, Korea’s cumulative installed photovoltaic \npower capacity was 3.43GW.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Korea’s installed geothermal capacity is 835.8MW.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ In 2015, the biggest biomass plant in Asia was opened \nin Korea. \n\n■■ By 2010, 4,000 residential boilers capable of using \nbiomass pellets had been installed.\n\n■■ KEPCO and most of its subsidiaries are focusing \non biomass as a means of achieving the Renewable \nPortfolio Standard.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Tidal flows around the Korean coastline are highly \nconducive for ocean energy, and the country is a clear \nleader in ocean energy in the region. Korea has the \nlargest tidal energy station in the world (see below).\n\n■■ The country has a basic three-stage strategic plan \nfor ocean energy development. Between 2008 and \n2012 the Government’s focus was on funding new \ntechnologies. From 2012 to 2020, the strategy is to \nincrease industry involvement and to “exploit relevant \ntechnologies”. From 2020 to 2030, the industry will \ntake the lead on the commercial development of \nocean energy.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ The renewable energy industry in Korea faces a \nnumber of structural difficulties. These include \nentrenched reliance on fossil fuels, a natural \nenvironment which is challenging for the renewables \nindustry and the competitiveness of other forms of \nenergy. \n\n■■ Wind power development has been hampered by \nthe country’s terrain, as well as problems in land \navailability. The competiveness of natural gas also \ninhibits the viability of new renewable energy-\ngenerated electricity. \n\n■■ In recent years, reductions in government subsidies \nfor solar power generation equipment has resulted \nin a decline in small-scale producers.\n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Basic Law on Low Carbon Green Energy 2010 \nestablishes a national strategy for low carbon, green \nenergy.\n\n■■ It also establishes and supports the Green Industries \nInvestment Company. The Government may provide \nfunds for a public institution to invest in the Green \nIndustries Investment Company.\n\n■■ Under the Law, the Government must establish and \nenforce a basic energy plan every five years. Such \nplans must include measures for the supply and use of \nrenewable energy.\n\n■■ The Promotion Act on Development, Use, Deployment of \nNew and Renewable Energy 2010 requires that where \npublic entities carry out construction of new buildings \nor renovation of existing buildings the design of these \nbuildings must incorporate certain renewable energy \nfeatures.\n\n\n\n106 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Korea no longer has a national feed-in tariff regime. \nInstead, Korea relies on a Renewables Portfolio \nStandard to encourage renewable energy generation. \n\n■■ Introduced in 2012, the Renewables Portfolio Standard \napplies to power providers with more than 500MW \nof power generating capacity. Power providers can \nmeet the standard by installing qualifying technologies. \nFor example, by using stationary fuel cells or by buying \nrenewable energy credits.\n\n■■ A fee of US$0.04 per renewable energy certificate \nis charged at the time of issuance and subsequent \npurchase and sale of renewable energy certificates.\n\n■■ In the case of a sale/purchase sale transaction, both \nthe buyer and the seller are required to pay this fee.\n\n■■ The scheme mandates the 18 largest public and private \nutilities to purchase or generate renewable energy \nat a rate equal to 10% of their share of total energy \ngeneration by 2024.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The largest biomass plant in Asia is located in Dangjin. \nIt has a capacity of 105MW and generates electricity \nmostly from palm kernel shells and some coal. \n\n■■ Ten coal plants are to be closed by 2025, two of which \nwill be converted to biomass plants. \n\n■■ In 2010, Korea announced plans to launch its first \nutility-scale offshore wind farm. While the project has \nbeen delayed since, several smaller scale offshore wind \n\nfarms have been installed in the waters off Jeju Island. \nThe overall goal is for these offshore wind farms to \nproduce 2.5GW. \n\n■■ Lake Sihwa tidal power station is the largest of its kind \nin the world. Completed in 2011, it has total output \ncapacity of 254MW. The project was partly funded by \nthe Korean Government. \n\n■■ Hyundai Heavy Industry, Samsung Heavy Industry, \nDaewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering and STX \nare some of the big names that have taken an interest \nin offshore wind energy.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Foreign Investment Promotion Act 1998 grants \nforeign-owned companies the same rights as domestic \ncompanies, and applies the same taxes as would apply \nto Korean companies and nationals. \n\n■■ Foreign ownership of Korean companies is common \nand the rules governing the formation of companies \nallows for 100% foreign ownership.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ South Korea ratified the Paris Agreement on \n3 November 2016.\n\n■■ South Korea has stated that it intends to reduce \nemissions by 37% from ‘business-as-usual’ rates by 2030. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 107\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ KEPCO – http://home.kepco.co.kr/kepco/EN/main.do\n\n■■ Ministry of Trade,

was occupied by the Japanese during World War Two. \nSingapore was part of the Federation of Malaya for two years until it declared independence in 1965. \nSingapore is now one of the world’s most prosperous nations in economic terms and has a highly developed \neconomy. Geographically, the city-state is confined by its small land area (about 700 km2, 20% of which is \nreclaimed land), but its strategic location, on the Strait of Malacca, has helped to boost its export capabilities. \nBy virtue of its history, location and rapid development, Singapore sits at the juncture of many cultures and \neconomies. Singapore’s revered founder, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, died in 2015. Traditionally, Mr Lee’s party, the \nPeople’s Action Party, has dominated Singapore’s political scene.\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n108 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 109\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Singapore is heavily dependent on fossil fuels for \nelectricity generation with at least 90% of electricity \nsourced from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). \n\n■■ LNG and other fossil fuels are predominantly \nimported from neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia, as \nwell as Australia and the Middle East. \n\n■■ 99.9% of Singapore is serviced by a single grid.\n\n■■ The Energy Policy Group is an inter-government \nagency organisation chaired by the Permanent \nSecretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In its \nNational Energy Policy Report, published in 2007, \nthe Energy Policy Group outlined six principles for \nSingapore’s energy sector:\n\n – promoting competition to keep energy affordable;\n\n – diversifying energy supplies to guard against supply \ndisruptions, price increases and other threats;\n\n – improving energy efficiency;\n\n – investing in the energy industry and research and \ndevelopment; \n\n – improving international cooperation methods; and \n\n – taking a whole-of-government approach to energy \nsecurity. \n\nElectricity Market\n\n■■ Since the late 1990s, Singapore has progressively \nliberalised its electricity market. The electricity \ngeneration and retail components were separated in \n2001.\n\n■■ The Energy Market Authority was formed in 2001 to \nprovide a new legal and regulatory framework for the \nelectricity and gas industries. Progression to full retail \nmarket liberalisation is currently in progress.\n\n■■ Also in 2001, the Energy Market Company was \nestablished to operate as an exchange for wholesale \nelectricity trading, and it has implemented the \nwholesale market systems, rules and business \nprocesses since 2002. In 2003, the National Electricity \nMarket of Singapore opened. \n\n■■ All of Singapore’s electricity is bought and sold \nthrough the Energy Market Company in the National \nElectricity Market of Singapore.\n\n■■ The market acts as a real-time electricity trading pool \nwhere power generation companies compete to sell \nelectricity every half-hour.\n\n■■ A commercial or industrial consumer with an average \nmonthly electricity consumption of at least 2,000kWh \nis eligible for ‘contestability’. If an eligible consumer \nchooses to be contestable, it will switch to buy \nelectricity from an electricity retailer or from the \nwholesale electricity market. \n\n■■ This is generally more cost-effective than continuing \nas a non-contestable consumer buying electricity \nat a regulated tariff (revised quarterly) from SP \nServices Limited. SP Services Limited is a subsidiary \nof Singapore Power, the energy utility company \nowning and operating Singapore’s electricity and \ngas transmission and distribution networks. For \nhouseholds, the regulated electricity tariff for the \nperiod from 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017 is \nS$0.202 (approx. US$0.14) per kWh. \n\n■■ Over the past few years, the threshold for \ncontestability eligibility has consistently dropped, with \nthe Government intending to remove it eventually, \nsuch that all electricity consumers in Singapore will \nbecome contestable when the retail electricity market \nis fully liberalised. \n\n■■ The Electricity Management System enables operators \nto monitor and control generation plants and \ntransmission networks in Singapore. The system \nprovides operators with information about generation \nplants, transmission stations as well as equipment and \ntransmission lines.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ As a general rule, a company is required to hold \na generation licence issued by the Energy Market \nAuthority if it generates electricity by means of one or \nmore generating units of 1MW or more but less than \n10MW and the generating unit is connected to the \npower grid. \n\n\n\n110 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ For generating units of less than 1MW that wish to \nbe paid for the electricity they export to the power \ngrid, the generating unit(s) must be registered with the \nEnergy Market Company and may have to compete \nto secure dispatch in the National Electricity Market. \nIf the aggregate capacity of the generating units owned \nby the company in a single location exceeds 10MW, \nthese generating units will have to bid in the electricity \nmarket to secure dispatch.\n\n■■ Singapore currently has 15 power generation \ncompanies connected to the grid. The following three \nentities together supply approximately 87% of the \ncountry’s electricity:\n\n – PowerSeraya, which is wholly owned by Malaysia’s \nYTL Power International;\n\n – Senoko Energy, which is owned by a consortium led \nby Japan’s Marubeni Corporation; and\n\n – Tuas Power, which is wholly owned by China’s \nHuaneng Power International.\n\n■■ The remaining generators are SembCorp Cogen, \nPacificLight Power Pte Ltd, Keppel Merlimau \nCogen, National Environment Agency, Shell Eastern \nPetroleum, Senoko Waste-To-Energy, ExxonMobil \nAsia Pacific, Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-To-Energy \nPlant, Tuaspring, TP Utilities, Singapore Refining \nCompany and TuasOne.\n\n■■ SP PowerAssets, a subsidiary of Singapore Power \n(which is wholly owned by Temasek Holdings), is the \nsole owner and provider of electricity transmission \nand distribution services in Singapore. SP PowerAssets \nhas appointed SP PowerGrid (being a further subsidiary \nof Singapore Power) to manage the operations of the \ntransmission and distribution networks.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Act (Chapter 89A) is the chief legislative \ntool to “create a competitive market framework \nfor the electricity industry, to make provision for \nthe safety, technical and economic regulation of \nthe generation, transmission, supply and use of \nelectricity”. Broadly, the Act:\n\n – sets out licensing requirements; \n\n – provides the Minister with the power to issue a \nspecial administration order (whereby an electricity \nlicensee shall be managed directly or indirectly by \nthe Energy Market Authority);\n\n – controls electricity licensees and entities with \ninterests in transmission systems;\n\n – establishes the wholesale electricity market; and\n\n – stipulates various offences. \n\n■■ The energy market regulatory functions were taken \nover by the Energy Market Authority under the Energy \nMarket Authority of Singapore Act (Chapter 92B). \n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The primary renewables focus of the Singapore \nGovernment is directed at research and development, \nenvironmental technology and energy efficiency, \nrather than renewable energy generation. \n\n■■ Solar energy and bioenergy are considered the best \nopportunities for renewable energy production in \nSingapore. Further research and development of these \ntechnologies is continuing, with the Government \nand private companies supporting a number of pilot \nprojects. \n\n■■ The Energy Market Authority, together with the \nNational Environment Agency, leads the Energy \nEfficiency Programme Office, to promote energy \nefficiency. \n\n■■ The Ministry of the Environment and Water \nResources deals with climate change issues, and the \nMinistry of Trade and Industry is responsible for \ndrafting and implementing energy market policy.\n\n■■ The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 plans for \nimplementation of the next phase of sustainable \ndevelopment. The blueprint sets out achievements \nfrom the past 10 years and sets targets for 2030, \nparticularly for better green spaces, resources \nsecurity, mobility and community stewardship and air \nquality and drainage in flood prone areas. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 111\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ While the country has a number of large reservoirs \nthrough its ‘green corridor’, there is limited means to \nproduce hydropower.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Singapore’s low wind speeds average, at 2m/s, is \ngenerally too slow for commercial wind turbines. \n\n■■ However, one local distributer, Cygnus Power, is \nworking on a number of projects in conjunction with \nNanyang Technological University’s Energy Research \nInstitute to harvest wind power with vertical axis \nturbines that are able to operate at low wind speeds. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Solar energy is regarded as the most feasible source of \nrenewable energy in Singapore. \n\n■■ The Government has prioritised the research and \ndevelopment of solar energy systems that can be \nintegrated into the urban environment given the city-\nstate’s limited land space. Two notable projects include \ninstalling solar panels on rooftops of high-rise public \nhousing developments and solar panel installations on \nwater surfaces in nature reserves. \n\n■■ The Government has invested in a number of funding \nand incentive programmes, including a 20% funding \nsubsidy for companies’ investment in energy efficient \nequipment or technologies and 50% subsidy for new \nfacilities or expansions, though these programmes are \nby no means limited to solar energy.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Researchers from the Singapore Magazine of Research, \nTechnology and Education have found that Singapore \nis situated on a world class heat flow anomaly with \npotential for geothermal energy, and recommend \nthat feasibility studies be undertaken to realise this \npotential. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Bioenergy currently only makes up a small percentage \nof Singapore’s energy production.\n\n■■ With more research and infrastructure, bioenergy will \nbe an important and economically viable renewable \nenergy source.\n\n■■ A new incineration plant is to be built by 2019 which will \ngenerate 800kWh of electricity per tonne of waste.\n\n\n\n112 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Singapore’s opportunities for ocean energy are limited \nby calm seas and commercial shipping routes through \nthe busy Strait of Malacca. \n\n■■ However, test centres have been installed to explore \nfurther the potential ocean and tidal energy holds.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE ENERGY SECTOR\n\n■■ Singapore is deeply reliant on natural gas and crude \noil imports from neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia. \nDiversification of this supply is a continuing challenge.\n\n■■ In 2016, the Minister of Trade and Industry announced \nthat steps were being taken towards improving \nflexibility and diversity of Singapore’s LNG supply. \nSingapore’s new tranche of LNG imports will come \nfrom the United States, Australia, Norway, Russia, \nQatar and Brunei, as it seeks to maintain its status as \na LNG hub.\n\n■■ Due to the small land availability in Singapore, \nit is unlikely the city-state will progress as a \nmass renewable energy generator. Rather, the \nGovernment’s vision for Singapore is to play a major \nrole in the development and manufacture of renewable \nenergy technology. \n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY LAWS\n\n■■ The Energy Conservation Act (Chapter 92C) introduced \nminimum energy management standards for large \nenergy users in the industry sector from 1 July 2012. \nThe standards only affect companies that consume \nmore than 54 terajoules of energy per calendar year. \nThe Energy Conservation Act is part of Singapore’s plan \nto achieve its target of 35% improvement in energy \nefficiency by 2030 from 2005 levels.\n\n■■ In 2017, there are discussions about possible \namendments to the Energy Conservation Act to spur \nfurther improvements in energy efficiency. The laws \nwere promised to deliver a 0.7% increase in energy \nefficiency in 2014 but had only delivered a 0.4% \nincrease. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Alongside its renewables focus, the Government \nhas been actively pushing for energy efficiency and \nconservation.\n\n■■ The Government supports a number of clean energy \nand energy efficiency grants and incentives. These \ngrants are primarily targeted at the improvement of \nenergy efficiency, research and innovation programs to \ndevelop new renewable energy technologies. \n\n■■ The Singapore Economic Development Board is \npiloting the Energy Efficiency Financing Programme \nwhere a third-party financier provides companies \nwith upfront capital to implement energy efficiency \nprojects, and the energy savings are shared between \nthe various stakeholders. \n\n■■ The Government also offers a one year depreciation \nallowance tax incentive to encourage large \ncompanies to invest in energy saving equipment. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ In 2016, the Renewable Energy Corporation \ncompleted the first stage of its committed solar \npower generation by installing 8,038 solar panels on \nthe rooftops of Tuas plants owned by Asia Pacific \nBreweries Singapore. This project is expected to \ngenerate 2.3 million kWh of clean energy per year \nand will reduce 1,500 tonnes of carbon emissions \nper year. \n\n■■ Singapore currently has the largest floating solar \ntest bed in the world, with systems installed from \neight companies comprising three local start-ups \nand five international companies. \n\n■■ Apple announced in 2015 that it would partner with \na Singapore solar energy provider to power 100% of \nits facilities with clean energy. \n\n■■ Goldman Sachs has agreed to finance projects in \nSingapore with Sunseap Leasing for an estimated \ncapacity of more than 30MW. This collaboration is \nexpected to create the funding platform for further \ninvestment above the initial 30MW target. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 113\n\n■■ CleanTech One, a ‘green’ industrial estates \ndeveloper, officially opened an eco-business park \nin Singapore in 2013. This ‘green complex’ is part \nof a joint government and private sector (primarily \nthe JTC Corporation) initiative to drive clean \ntechnology industry in Singapore and encourage \nmore businesses to embrace sustainability. \n\n■■ Vestas Wind Systems will reportedly invest up to \nS$500 million (approx. US$356 million) by around \n2020 in Singapore. Vestas is currently a part of a \nproject to power micro grids with wind turbines \nwhich could have potential application across \nSoutheast Asia. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Singapore is a hub for multinational corporations \nand foreign investment. The city-state’s financial \nstability, tax incentives, advantageous loans and \nminimal restrictions on foreign corporations make it \nan attractive financial centre.\n\n■■ The industries that are restricted include media, \nbroadcasting, legal, property ownership and retail \nbanking.\n\n■■ UNFCCC – PARIS AGREEMENT \nCOMMITMENTS AND BEYOND\n\n■■ Singapore signed the Paris Agreement on \n22 April 2016 and ratified the agreement on \n21 September 2016. Singapore has committed to \ncut emissions intensity from 2005 to 2030 by 36%, \nand stabilise greenhouse gas emissions with the \naim of peaking around 2030. \n\n■■ Singapore accounts for approximately 0.11% of \nglobal emissions but acknowledges its heavy \ndependence on fossil fuels.\n\n■■ Singapore has committed to harness solar energy \nand invest in other innovative forms of renewable \nenergy to meet its commitments. \n\n\n\n114 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Ministry of Environment and Water Resources – http://app.mewr.gov.sg \n\n■■ Ministry of Trade and Industry – https://www.mti.gov.sg/ \n\n■■ Energy Market Authority – http://www.ema.gov.sg/\n\n■■ Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore – http://www.seas.org.sg/ \n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Energy Market Authority, EMA Annual Report 2016, accessed at: https://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Publications_\nand_Statistics/Publications/SES/2016/Singapore%20Energy%20Statistics%202016.pdf \n\n■■ Reegle, Country Energy Profile Singapore, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/singapore-energy-profile/SG \n\n■■ Singapore Economic Development Board, Alternative Energy, accessed at: http://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/\nindustries/industries/alternative-energy.html \n\n■■ Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore, White Paper on Renewable Energy 2014, accessed at: https://www.scribd.\ncom/document/202443420/White-Paper-on-Accelerating-Renewable-Energy-in-Singapore\n\n■■ International Renewable Energy Agency, Singapore, accessed at: http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/\ncountrySearch/?countryCode=SGP \n\n■■ Innovation Magazine, Geothermal Power for Singapore, accessed at: http://www.innovationmagazine.com/volumes/\nv10n2/coverstory1.html \n\n■■ National Climate Change Secretariat Strategy Group, Singapore’s Approach to Alternative Energy, accessed at: \nhttps://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/national-circumstances/singapores-approach-alternative-energy\n\n■■ Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015, accessed at: \nhttp://www.mewr.gov.sg/ssb/files/ssb2015.pdf \n\n■■ Singapore Economic Development Board, Energy Industry, accessed at: https://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/\nindustries/industries/energy.html \n\n114 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttp://app.mewr.gov.sg\nhttps://www.mti.gov.sg/\nhttp://www.ema.gov.sg/\nhttp://www.seas.org.sg/\nhttps://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Publications_and_Statistics/Publications/SES/2016/Singapore Energy Statistics 2016.pdf\nhttps://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Publications_and_Statistics/Publications/SES/2016/Singapore Energy Statistics 2016.pdf\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/singapore-energy-profile/SG\nhttp://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/industries/industries/alternative-energy.html\nhttp://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/industries/industries/alternative-energy.html\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/202443420/White-Paper-on-Accelerating-Renewable-Energy-in-Singapore\nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/202443420/White-Paper-on-Accelerating-Renewable-Energy-in-Singapore\nhttp://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/countrySearch/?countryCode=SGP\nhttp://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/countrySearch/?countryCode=SGP\nhttp://www.innovationmagazine.com/volumes/v10n2/coverstory1.html\nhttp://www.innovationmagazine.com/volumes/v10n2/coverstory1.html\nhttps://www.nccs.gov.sg/climate-change-and-singapore/national-circumstances/singapores-approach-alternative-energy\nhttp://www.mewr.gov.sg/ssb/files/ssb2015.pdf\nhttps://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/industries/industries/energy.html\nhttps://www.edb.gov.sg/content/edb/en/industries/industries/energy.html\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 115\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Common law, civil law and customary law\n\nLanguage: Sinhala and Tamil\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Doing Business Report: 110 of 190 (down 1 ranking) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: 71 of 138 (down 3 rankings) \n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 112 of 180 (down 19 rankings) \n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 95 of 176 (down 12 rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 73 of 188 (no change) \n\nPopulation: 21 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$3,800\n\nPROFILE\n\nSri Lanka was colonised in the 16th century and became independent from British rule in 1948. The nation \nwent through a civil war spanning 26 years between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan \nGovernment. The civil war ended in 2009. Since the end of the conflict, Sri Lanka’s social and economic \nindicators have significantly improved, evidenced by 98% adult literacy and strong, steady economic growth. \nIn January 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ousted the former \nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa amidst allegations of misappropriation of public funds. Sirisena began his time as \nPresident with a focus on forging equally strong relationships with India, China, Pakistan and Japan.\n\nSRI LANKA\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 115\n\n\n\n116 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In 2014, total electricity generation was 12,357GWh. \nElectricity generation comprised of 36.7% from \nhydropower (including small hydro), 60.76% from \nthermal power (including biomass, coal and all other \nfuel-oil sources) and 2.54% from other renewables \n(including solar and wind power). Total installed \ncapacity in 2014 was 3.932GWh.\n\n■■ The share of thermal power in total generation has \ndramatically increased from 1% in 1986 to 60.76% \nin 2014. \n\n■■ As at 2016, Sri Lanka’s electrification rate was \n98%, with only a small number of remote parts of \nthe island still off the grid. In July 2016, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank approved a loan of US$115 \nmillion (approx. Rs17.4 billion) to help Sri Lanka \nachieve 100% electrification.\n\n■■ More than half of Sri Lanka’s consumers get access \nto very cheap electricity (around the equivalent \nof US$0.03 (approx. Rs3.44) per kWh). The most \nexpensive bracket of electricity is available at US$0.10 \n(approx. Rs11.46) per kWh.\n\n■■ Sri Lanka’s electricity demand is expected to increase \nby 36% between 2015 and 2020.\n\n■■ The Ministry of Power and Energy is responsible for \nthe management of the power sector, and plays a role \nin the following state-owned energy institutions:\n\n – the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka \n(PUCSL), which since 2009 has been the regulator \nfor energy;\n\n – the Ceylon Electricity Board, which was created in \n1969; and\n\n – the Lanka Electricity Company, formed in 1983 as a \ncompany under the Companies Act 1982. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Electricity Act 2009 (as amended in 2013) is the \nmain piece of legislation governing the electricity \nsector. It creates licence requirements and requires \nthe Government to own shares in any company that \noperates a generation plant with more than 25MW. \n\n■■ The Public Utilities Commission Act 2002, together with \nthe Electricity Act 2009, establishes PUCSL as the \nindependent regulator of the generation, transmission, \ndistribution, supply and use of energy.\n\n■■ The Ceylon Electricity Board Act 1969 establishes the \nCeylon Electricity Board. \n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ The Ceylon Electricity Board generates approximately \nhalf the electricity in the country, while the other half \nis generated by private or semi-private small power \nproducers. The Board also distributes approximately \n90% of all electricity to customers, while the Lanka \nElectricity Company (Private) Limited purchases \nelectricity from the Ceylon Electricity Board and \ndistributes the remaining 10%. \n\n■■ The Board is the monopoly operator of a single \ntransmission network for the entire country, which is \ncomprised of overhead transmission lines.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Currently, 39.24% of Sri Lanka’s total installed power \ngeneration capacity comes from renewable energy \nsources. \n\n■■ Sri Lanka’s target is to increase the contribution of \nrenewable sources to 60% of total power generation \nby 2020 and to 70% by 2030.\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Central Sri Lanka’s mountainous topography, \ncombined with biannual monsoons, creates excellent \nopportunities for hydropower and is a key source of \nenergy generation.\n\n■■ Hydropower has been in operation since 1950, and \nhas been extensively developed. All 16 major hydro \nplants are owned by the Ceylon Electricity Board. \nMajor hydropower accounts for 50% of electricity \ngeneration, 41.3% of installed capacity and 13% of \nenergy supply.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 117\n\n■■ Small private hydro producers sell power to the \nnational grid. The number and contribution of small \nhydro has increased significantly due to higher \nelectricity demand, competitive feed-in tariffs and \ndelays in government-owned projects.\n\n■■ In 2016, Laugfs Power Limited acquired Pams \nPower Limited for 200 million rupees (approx. \nUS$1.7 million) in order to build a small hydropower \nplant in Sri Lanka.\n\n■■ In January 2017, the PUCSL released a statement \noutlining its concern that if the drought continued in \nSri Lanka, hydropower could only be generated until \nthe end of February 2017.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ US studies have indicated that Sri Lanka has ‘good \nto excellent’ wind resources, especially in the north \nand north-west coastal regions and in the central \nhighlands.\n\n■■ It is estimated that there is approximately 5,000km2 \n\nof windy areas that could conservatively support \n25,000MW of potential installed capacity.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Sri Lanka has well over 100,000 solar home or remote \npower systems installed, both on and off-grid.\n\n■■ In September 2016, the Sri Lankan Government \nlaunched a plan to add 220MW of solar power to \nthe country’s grid by 2020 (which is the equivalent of \nroughly 10% of the nation’s current daily electricity \ndemand). The Government hopes to increase its solar \nenergy output to 1,000MW by 2025.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ According to geologists, there is a potential \ngeothermal belt running from the north of \nTrincomalee to Hambanota which has about ten \nidentified thermal springs situated along the line. This \nsuggests that a sufficient reservoir of geothermal \nenergy exists in Sri Lanka.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Firewood and bagasse (sugar cane waste) are the \nmost common energy source in Sri Lanka, used in the \ndomestic sector because of its abundant availability. \n\n■■ Biomass energy consumption has been increasing \nconsistently at around 3% per year. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Sri Lanka has an ambitious target of reaching 60% \nrenewable energy contribution by 2020, which is a jump \nof approximately 20% on current renewables levels. \n\n■■ As energy demand has increased nationwide, so too \nhas reliance upon fossil fuels. Coal power plants have \nbeen built in Norochcholai to significantly increase total \ncapacity. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act 2007 \ncreated the authority of the same name which is charged \nwith regulating renewable natural resources.\n\n■■ According to the Electricity Act 2009, the Government \nmust own shares of privately-owned renewable energy \nfacilities with a capacity exceeding 25MW.\n\n■■ The National Environmental Act requires environmental \nclearance to be obtained for thermal power plants \nexceeding 25MW, or hydro power plants exceeding \n50MW.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Sri Lanka has had feed-in tariffs since 1997. In 2010, \nthe Sri Lanka Energy Authority implemented more \nsophisticated cost-based, technology-specific feed-\nin tariffs. These are available for power plants with \ncapacities of less than 10MW, however investors are able \nto negotiate for a lower tariff for power plants between \n10 to 25MW.\n\n■■ Investors can opt for either a three-tier tariff, which \noffsets higher start-up costs, or a fixed rate tariff, both of \nwhich run for a period of 20 years. Sri Lanka also offers \nhigher feed-in tariff rates for wind and hydro facilities that \nuse locally-manufactured turbines.\n\n\n\n118 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Asian Development Bank loaned Sri Lanka \nUS$300 million in two instalments for Sri Lanka’s \nClean Energy and Network Efficiency Improvement \nProject. The first instalment in 2014 was for a 30MW \nhydro plant in Moragolla and upgrades to transmission \ncapacity. The second instalment in 2016 funded the \nexpansion of transmission and voltage lines to connect \nwind farms to the grid. \n\n■■ The Uma Oya Hydropower plant is in construction \nand will add another 120MW of renewable energy to \nthe national grid. The project is set to be completed \nby 2018.\n\n■■ In late 2016, President Sirisena initiated a project to \ninstall solar panels on the rooftops of households, \nwhich is expected to add 200MW of solar electricity \nto the national grid by 2020 and 1,000MW by 2025. \n\n■■ In March 2017, the Government also announced an \ninternational bid process to build a 100MW floating \nsolar power plant in the Madura Oya reservoir. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Significant Chinese and other investment in Sri Lankan \nports, combined with Asian Development Bank \nfunding of domestic transport infrastructure, has made \ntransport of building and other materials significantly \neasier in recent years.\n\n■■ Whilst foreign direct investment is crucial to allow \nSri Lanka to meet its plans for economic growth, the \nnation is still protectionist in relation to its policy on \nimports. The high transaction costs and economic \ninstability make constant flows of FDI difficult to \nattain.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Sri Lanka ratified the Paris Agreement on \n21 September 2016 and committed to pursue more \nenvironmentally-friendly renewable energy projects. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 119\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Asian Development Bank (Sri Lanka) – http://www.adb.org/countries/sri-lanka/main\n\n■■ Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka – http://www.pucsl.gov.lk/english\n\n■■ Ministry of Power and Energy – http://powermin.gov.lk/english/ \n\n■■ Ceylon Electricity Board – http://www.ceb.lk/ \n\n■■ Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority – http://www.energy.gov.lk/ \n\n■■ Energy Forum of Sri Lanka – http://efsl.lk/ \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka’s Power Generation, Renewable Energy Prospective, accessed at: http://www.\ncarbonexpo.com/redaktionell/carbon_expo/downloads_28/pdf_35/2016_4/praesentationen/Noel-Priyantha.pdf\n\n■■ Oxford Business Group, The role of renewable power in Sri Lanka’s energy mix set to expand, accessed at: https://www.\noxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/sustainable-generation-role-renewable-power-sources-set-expand\n\n■■ Climatescope, Sri Lanka, accessed at: http://global-climatescope.org/en/country/sri-lanka/#/details\n\n■■ Export.gov, Sri Lanka – Openness to and Restriction on Foreign Investment, accessed at: https://www.export.gov/\narticle?id=Sri-Lanka-Openness-to-Foreign-Investment\n\n■■ Reegle, Sri Lanka, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/sri-lanka-energy-profile/LK \n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 119\n\nhttp://www.adb.org/countries/sri-lanka/main\nhttp://www.pucsl.gov.lk/english\nhttp://powermin.gov.lk/english/\nhttp://www.ceb.lk/\nhttp://www.energy.gov.lk/\nhttp://efsl.lk/\nhttp://www.carbonexpo.com/redaktionell/carbon_expo/downloads_28/pdf_35/2016_4/praesentationen/Noel-Priyantha.pdf\nhttp://www.carbonexpo.com/redaktionell/carbon_expo/downloads_28/pdf_35/2016_4/praesentationen/Noel-Priyantha.pdf\nhttps://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/sustainable-generation-role-renewable-power-sources-set-expand\nhttps://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/sustainable-generation-role-renewable-power-sources-set-expand\nhttp://global-climatescope.org/en/country/sri-lanka/#/details\nhttps://www.export.gov/article?id=Sri-Lanka-Openness-to-Foreign-Investment\nhttps://www.export.gov/article?id=Sri-Lanka-Openness-to-Foreign-Investment\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/sri-lanka-energy-profile/LK\n\n\n120 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nJurisdiction: Civil law\n\nLanguage: Tetum and Portuguese (Official Languages); Bahasa Indonesia and English (Working Languages) as \nwell as various local languages and dialects\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n2017 Ease of Doing Business Report: 175 of 190 (down 2 rankings) \n\n2016/17 Global Competitiveness Index: Not listed\n\n2017 Index of Economic Freedom: 173 of 180 (no change)\n\n2016 Corruption Perceptions Index: 101 of 176 (up 22 rankings) \n\n2015 UN Development Programme Human Development Index: 133 of 188 (down 5 rankings)\n\nPopulation: 1.2 million\n\nGNI per capita: US$2,180\n\nPROFILE\n\nTimor-Leste was a Portuguese colony for nearly 500 years. Following a period of Indonesian occupation \nfrom 1975 to 1999, Timor-Leste emerged as the first newly created sovereign State of the 21st century. East \nTimor (as it has been previously known) has since built a strong foundation for ongoing stability through a \nconsultative and unity-focussed governance structure and through successful management of the country’s \nPetroleum Fund. The country continues to implement its Strategic Development Plan 2011 – 2030, which \nsets out an ambitious vision for the nation’s future as a stable democracy and upper-middle income economy. \nTimor-Leste is seeking full membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nTIMOR-LESTE\n\n120 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 121\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Timor-Leste’s infrastructure, including its electricity \nassets, were destroyed by pro-Indonesia militias in \n1999. According to the United Nations however, by \n2014 Timor-Leste had a total electricity capacity of \n236MW. This represents a significant increase on the \n44MW capacity it had only five years earlier.\n\n■■ In 2015, a new 17MW power station in Sacato came \nonline, providing electricity to the enclave of Oecusse-\nAmbeno.\n\n■■ The capital and largest city, Dili, has an electrification \nrate of 85%, yet rural electrification rates range from \nbetween 5% and 18%, with estimates of total nation-\nwide electrification at just 22%. Only Dili and Baucau \n(the second largest city) have a constant electricity \nsupply, though power outages occur.\n\n■■ The majority of Timor-Leste’s power supply is based \non imported oil for diesel power generation, and while \nthe price of crude oil has halved since mid-2014, these \ngenerators continue to be uneconomical.\n\n■■ The Timor-Leste Government has commissioned a \nnew 150kV, 715km long transmission line. The line will \ncircumvent the country linking the Hera Generating \nStation, the Betano Generating Station, nine \nsubstations and the Dili control centre.\n\n■■ In its five year legislative agenda (2012 – 2017), the \nformer Xanana Gusmão-led Government committed \nto the continued upgrade and expansion of the \nnational grid. An additional 10 substations have also \nbeen proposed to deal with an expected increase of \n210MW in generating capacity.\n\n■■ The program of the Sixth Constitutional Government, \nled by Prime Minister Dr. Rui Maria de Araújo, \nincludes a pledge to ensure that all of Timor-Leste has \naccess to electricity 24 hours a day, and has stated that \nrenewable energy and complete rural electrification \nare two priorities for the Government. \n\n■■ The Government has also stated that it will be \nconsidering the most appropriate status of the state-\nowned electricity producer, Electricidade de Timor-\nLeste (EDTL), with a view to increasing revenue.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ There were a number of attempts to commence \nelectricity regulation by the United Nations \nTransitional Administration in Timor-Leste \n(UNTAET) and now the Timor-Leste Government. \nThese include:\n\n – UNTAET Directive No. 2001/10 on Fees and \nCharges for Electricity and Related Services;\n\n – UNTAET Directive No. 2002/07 on Amendment \non the Schedule of Fees and Charges for Electricity \nand Related Services; and\n\n – Government Decree Law No. 13/2003 establishing \nthe Basis for the National Electricity System \n(the Basic Law).\n\n■■ Perhaps the most important aspect of the Basic \nLaw is its provision for the future establishment of \na Universal Service Operator for the generation, \ndistribution and transmission of electricity. When \nestablished, the Universal Service Operator will have \npublic utility status bringing with it various public and \nprivate rights, responsibilities and duties.\n\n■■ The Basic Law provides that if a private body \ncorporate is appointed as the Universal Service \nOperator, it must be through a concession contract. \nConcession contracts must be announced and open \nto an international tendering process.\n\n■■ Other key points of the Basic Law include the:\n\n – appointment of a Regulatory Authority (however \ngovernment ministries and the State Secretariat for \nEnergy Policy currently act as de facto regulators);\n\n – establishment of binding producers after the \nRegulatory Authority’s tendering process;\n\n – establishment of non-binding producers who may \nobtain either domestic or commercial licences; and\n\n – establishment of tariff regulations governing the \n“criteria and methods for formulating and fixing \ntariffs and rates for electricity”.\n\n\n\n122 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ EDTL has a monopoly on the supply and distribution \nof electricity to Dili and the 11 district capitals. EDTL \nis almost completely funded by the Government, \nhowever donor countries provide technical assistance. \n\n■■ The World Bank has funded projects aimed at \nimproving electricity supply, including financing the \nrepair of the Comoro power station and work on \nDili’s power distribution infrastructure.\n\n■■ The Asian Development Bank is also actively involved \nin financing projects in the country.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ An Asian Development Bank report highlights \nhydropower and wind as the most promising \nrenewable energy sources for Timor-Leste. However, \ncheap stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems are seen \nas a solution to rural electrification for houses that \ncannot be connected to the grid.\n\n■■ Timor-Leste’s mountainous terrain poses difficulty for \nmuch of the country’s infrastructure development, \nincluding for large-scale power plants and transmission \ninfrastructure. \n\n■■ NGOs (often with donor-country support) have been \nactively involved in Timor-Leste. For instance, the \nAlternative Technology Association has (since 2003) \nsent volunteers to install solar and wind installations \nin schools, hospitals, offices and other community \nbuildings.\n\n■■ Government, World Bank and other feasibility \nresearch into renewable energy has been undertaken.\n\nHydropower\n\n■■ HydroTimor oversees the development of \nhydropower in the country.\n\n■■ It is estimated that Timor-Leste has a total potential of \nbetween 80MW and 252MW of hydropower capacity. \nThe 27MW Ira Lalaro hydropower project is the most \nfeasible project.\n\n■■ The steep topography and frequent small earthquakes \nin Timor-Leste pose some obstacles to hydropower.\n\n■■ Micro and mini hydropower projects may become \nan interim power source for villages unlikely to be \nconnected to the national grid within the next 10 to \n15 years.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 123\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Studies have shown that there is great potential for \nwind power generation (approximately 72MW) in \nEast Timor.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Timor-Leste has high rates of solar radiation and is \nwell-suited to solar photovoltaic installations.\n\n■■ It is estimated that between 10,000 and 50,000 solar \nphotovoltaic systems will be needed for households \nthat will not be connected to the national distribution \nnetwork in the next 15 years. Capital subsidies will be \nneeded to reduce start-up costs, however operation \nand maintenance costs are low.\n\n■■ An Australian not-for-profit known as the Alternative \nTechnology Association has, since 2003, installed solar \npanels in over 1,500 East Timorese school, homes, and \nhospitals. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Based on geological surveys, it is unlikely that \nEast Timor could use geothermal energy as a large-\nscale means of energy production. However, the \ncountry is geologically active with large unexplored \nareas, particularly on the south coast.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ The majority of energy in rural and remote areas is \nsourced from biomass fuels.\n\n■■ 78MW of biomass, biogas and waste-to-energy \nprojects are currently being developed by the \nGovernment.\n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ Timor-Leste’s coastline is characterised by steep \nunderwater drop-offs, which may prove beneficial to \nthe future development of ocean energy. \n\n\n\n124 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ The lack of a settled land law and difficulties around \nproject financing are two common concerns of \ninvestors in Timor-Leste. \n\n■■ It is likely that Timor-Leste will require financial \nsupport either from the Asian Development Bank, \na foreign government or an NGO to construct a \nviable renewables industry. An alternative would be \nfor the Government to consider guaranteed feed-\nin tariff rates, as has occurred in other Asia-Pacific \njurisdictions.\n\n■■ The Government has entrusted the country’s first \nPrime Minister, Dr Mari Alkatiri, with administering \n‘special social market economy zones’ in the enclave \nof Oecusse-Ambeno and on the island of Ataúro \nrespectively. These zones have a broad development \nfocus and could include the development of renewable \nenergy facilities. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ At time of writing, the Council of Ministers was \nconsidering establishing regulations for the renewable \nenergy sector and the establishment of a National \nRenewable Energy Council. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ At time of writing, the National Parliament is \nconsidering a revised foreign investment regime \nwhich is broadly seen as more favourable to foreign \ninvestors. For now, however, the governing law is \nthe Private Investment Law No. 14/2011. The law offers \nvarious incentives for foreign investors such as income \ntax exemptions and customs duty exemptions.\n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Government has committed to complete \nconstruction on the Lariguto wind farm as well as \nthe Bobonaro wind farm and to connect them to \nthe national grid.\n\n■■ The Government has also vowed to establish a solar \ncentre in Hera. Recently, Dutch beer giant Heineken, \ncommenced construction on a US$40 million \nmanufacturing hub near the existing Hera power plant, \nwhich is seen as an historic investment in the country \nand an indication of the reliability of the power supply \nin the area.\n\n■■ The Ira Lalaro hydropower project has the potential \nto meet a significant amount of Timor-Leste’s \nelectricity needs. It is considered the most cost \neffective hydropower project, in part due to the Ira \nLalaro Lake which would provide natural storage for \nthe plant.\n\n■■ Other hydropower projects are run-of-river type \nplants at Gleno, Belulic and Laclo.\n\n■■ A 10MW to 15MW wind power project has been \nidentified in Foho Bagarkoholau, 10km south of Dili.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ While a new foreign investment regime is currently \nbefore National Parliament, the existing regime is the \nPrivate Investment Law No. 14/2011. The law establishes \na legal framework to attract and promote foreign \ninvestment. \n\n■■ In 2011, Timor-Leste’s Parliament established the \nNational Investment Agency to further streamline and \nencourage foreign investment.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Timor-Leste signed the Paris Agreement on \n22 April 2016. Timor-Leste released its Intended \nNationally Determined Contribution in January 2017. \nWhile the document did not set a specific carbon \nreduction target, it focuses on economy-wide plans \nand actions.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 125\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Timor-Leste Government website – http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?lang=en\n\n■■ Program of the Sixth Constitutional Government (2015-2017) – http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?cat=39&lang=en#prog2.3 \n\n■■ TradeInvest Timor-Leste – http://easttimornow.com.au/trade/tradeinvest.aspx \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ W.

Numerous military \ncoups have occurred throughout the country’s modern history. The most recent military coup ousted Prime \nMinister Yingluck Shinawatra in 2014. Despite this political unrest, Thailand remains one of the most advanced \neconomies in Southeast Asia and has a liberal and pro-investment economy. In late 2016, the country went \ninto a period of mourning following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the longest-serving head of state \nin the world. His son, Maha Vajiralongkorn has since been crowned King. Democratic elections are tentatively \nscheduled for 2018, to allow time for necessary legislative reforms transitioning the country back to civilian rule. \n\nTHAILAND\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 127\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Thailand is heavily reliant on energy imports, notably \noil and gas. Foreign imports constitute 57% of \nThailand’s natural gas usage.\n\n■■ Total energy expenditure in 2014 was US$66 billion. \n\n■■ Over the last decade, energy consumption has grown \n3.2% year on year.\n\n■■ Natural gas (66%) is the largest source of energy, \nfollowed by coal (20%). Renewable energy represents \n12% of total consumption.\n\n■■ A rural electrification program instigated in the 1970s \nhas resulted in 98% electrical coverage in households \nthroughout Thailand. \n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ The Thailand Power Development Plan was \nintroduced in 2015. The Plan prioritises energy \nsecurity, cost-appropriateness of power generation \nand energy efficiency, and reducing the environmental \nand social impacts of carbon pollution. \n\n■■ The plan envisages large hydropower, nuclear energy \nand fossil fuel sources as the dominant contributors to \nmeet Thailand’s growing electricity demand.\n\nGovernment bodies\n\n■■ The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, a \nstate-owned company, controls 60% of generation \ncapacity as well as the entire transmission system \n(the remainder of generation is supplied by \nindependent producers such as the Electricity \nGenerating Company and the Ratchburi Electricity \nGenerating Holding Public Company Ltd \n(RATCH)). \n\n■■ The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand sells \nelectricity to two retail suppliers, the Metropolitan \nElectricity Authority for Bangkok and the Provincial \nElectricity Authority for areas outside Bangkok. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy oversees all other government \nbodies in the sector, including the:\n\n – National Energy Policy Council, which is comprised \nof cabinet members who prepare guidelines for the \nimplementation of the energy program which are \nthen administered by the National Energy Policy \nand Planning Office;\n\n – Department of Alternative Energy Development \nand Efficiency;\n\n – Department of Energy Business;\n\n – Department of Mineral Fuel, which regulates the \nbusiness of exploration and exploitation in oil and \ngas activities in Thailand;\n\n – Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates \nthe activities of operators in the electricity sector \nand enforces the Energy Business Act 2007. It is \nchaired by the Prime Minister; and\n\n – Energy Conservation Centre of Thailand, which \nprovides technical expertise and services to \npromote energy conservation. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Energy Industry Act 2007 governs and regulates \nenergy business in Thailand. The Act seeks to allow \nmore participation in the energy sector by private \nenterprise. The Act is pitched in broad terms, which \nprovide for the promotion of adequate and secure \nenergy services, protection of energy consumers, \npromotion of competition, fairness and efficiency. \nThe Act also establishes the Energy Regulatory \nCommission, and delegates certain powers to the \nCommission.\n\n■■ The Small and Very Small Power Purchase Agreements \nAct 2007 regulates the connection of small producers \nto the electricity grid, being a base for solar, wind, \nbiomass and mini hydropower. This Act was amended \nin 2009. Small producers have been further supported \nby government policies including the Thailand Power \nDevelopment Plan 2015 and the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Plan 2015.\n\n■■ The National Policy Council Act 2008 establishes the \nNational Energy Policy Council which approves \nproject plans and energy policy developed by the \nNational Economic and Social Development Board. \n\n\n\n128 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Thailand is considered to be a leading renewable \nenergy provider in Southeast Asia, particularly for \nsolar power. The Thai Government was one of the \nfirst countries in the region to develop incentives for \nrenewable energy generation. \n\n■■ The goal of renewable energy policy in Thailand is \ncharacterised by a shift in reliance on large utilities \ntowards a decentralised model comprising renewable \nenergy projects.\n\n■■ Around US$2 billion was invested in solar projects \nalone in 2015, a large increase from the US$1.5 billion \ninvested in all renewable energy in 2011.\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Plan organises \nthe Ministry of Energy’s strategy for energy \nconsumption leading up to 2036, passed by resolution \nof the National Energy Policy Council in 2014. \n\n■■ The Ministry of Energy also drafts Distribution \nNetwork Development Plans every five years, \ncontaining targets to ensure connectivity, \nimplementing guidelines and regulatory frameworks \nestablished by the Thailand Smart Grid Masterplan. \n\nAlternative Energy Development Plan\n\n■■ The Thai Government approved the revised \nAlternative Energy Development Plan (2015 to 2036) \nin June 2015.\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Plan establishes \nstrong objectives, with a renewable energy capacity \ntarget of 20GW by 2036, comprising:\n\n – 6,000MW of solar energy;\n\n – 3,002MW of wind energy;\n\n – 3,282MW of hydropower;\n\n – 5,570MW of biomass energy;\n\n – 1,280MW if biogas energy;\n\n – 680MW of energy crops;\n\n – 600MW of wastewater energy; and\n\n – 550MW of waste-to-energy energy.\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Plan \ncontemplates a renewable energy consumption \ntarget of 30% by 2036 (the more generic Power \nDevelopment Plan also has similar renewables targets). \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Hydropower has strong potential in Thailand. Despite \nbeing historically underutilised and heavily imported \nfrom other countries, hydropower capacity has \nincreased. \n\n■■ There is strong potential for small hydropower \nprojects in the east and central part of Thailand.\n\n■■ Hydropower capacity has increased substantially, with \na total installed capacity of 3,484MW.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Thailand’s wind power generation is increasing. \nIn 2015, total production was 234.5MW, more than \ndouble that of 2012 and far larger than the 7.3MW \ngenerated in 2011.\n\n■■ Central, western and coastal regions of Thailand have \nbeen investigated as possible turbine sites. \n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ The north and north-eastern regions of Thailand \nreceive an average of six to eight sunshine hours per \nday, making Thailand an attractive destination for solar \nphotovoltaic projects.\n\n■■ At approximately 1,300MW, Thailand has the largest \nsolar power capacity in Southeast Asia.\n\n■■ The Alternative Energy Development Plan’s target \nfor solar power generation is a capacity of 6,000MW \nby 2036.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ The geothermal industry will likely not contribute \nsignificantly to Thailand’s renewable energy target. \nA geothermal target of just 1MW by 2021 underlines \nThailand’s reliance on other sources of renewable \nenergy. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 129\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Biomass energy represents a significant component of \nThailand’s renewable energy capacity, amounting to \n2,679MW in 2015.\n\n■■ The 2036 target prescribed by the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Plan for biomass is 5,570MW, an \nincrease from the 2,679MW generated in 2015.\n\n■■ The 2036 target for biogas is lower, at 600MW. This is \nalmost double the 359MW figure for 2015. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ As with other nations in Southeast Asia, energy \nsecurity is a major issue in Thailand. The country is \nreliant on natural gas imports from other countries \nincluding Myanmar, as well as hydropower imports \nfrom Laos. The total cost of energy imports is \nestimated to be about 12% of the country’s GDP. This \nreliance, coupled with growing electricity demand, \nhas created a strong incentive for increasing domestic \nenergy production through renewable resources.\n\n■■ Analysts have noted a lack of a balanced renewable \nenergy portfolio in Thailand with solar and biogas \ngeneration being substantially larger than wind and \nhydropower. The targets in the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Plan reflect the need to develop a more \ndiverse supply of renewable energy. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Energy Development and Promotion Act 1992 \ngives the Department of Energy Development and \nPromotion broad powers to regulate production, \ntransformation, utilisation and conservation of energy \nsources.\n\n■■ The Energy Conservation Promotion Act 2007 promotes \nthe efficient use of electricity. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ A new feed-in tariff scheme commenced in 2013, \nfocussing on solar. The tariff differentiates between \nrooftop solar photovoltaic, community-owned solar \nand ground-mounted installations. \n\n■■ The Board of Investment Promotion (chaired by \nthe Prime Minister) allows an eight year corporate \nincome tax exemption for manufacturing solar cells, \ngeneration of alternative source energy, manufacturing \nof energy saving machinery or renewable energy \nequipment and machinery and energy services \nconsulting firms who provide consulting services on \nthe use or installation of energy-saving machinery and \nequipment. \n\n■■ Furthermore, a Board of Investment certificate grants \nforeign companies who make a “major investment’ \nunder the Investment Promotion Act 2002 a number of \nbenefits including permission to conduct a “restricted \nbusiness” as defined under the Foreign Business Act \n1999 to bring in foreign skilled workers, permission \nto own land (not normally allowed for foreigners), \nexemption on import duties and reduction of \ncorporate income tax. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ Asia Biogas began the commercial operation of its \nwaste-to-energy plant in the Thai region of Krabi in \n2016. \n\n■■ Gunkul Engineering PCL will commence the \nconstruction of 33 new turbines in the first quarter \nof 2017 at Sarahnlom wind farm. It will have a total \ncapacity of 67.5MW. The wind turbines, which will \nbe the tallest in Asia, will be supplied by the Spanish \nmanufacturer Gamesa.\n\n■■ Energy Absolute PCL’s 90MW solar farm in Nakhon \nSawan began operation in 2014 and has announced \nthat a 126MW capacity wind farm will be built in \nNakhon Si Thammarat in 2017.\n\n■■ National Energy Development Co’s Lopburi Solar \nFarm, which was constructed from 2010 and financed \nby a US$70 million loan from the Asian Development \nBank, increased its operational capacity to 84MW in \n2013.\n\n■■ The Asian Development Bank has contributed funding \nto other solar projects in Thailand. It announced \nlending of US$85 million to Solarco for three solar \nplants with total capacity of 57MW. \n\n\n\n130 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ Thailand’s largest solar power project is run by Solar \nPower Co Ltd. The project involves the construction \nof 6MW of solar facilities at 34 different sites, \npredominantly in north-eastern Thailand.\n\n■■ Wind Energy Holding Co is planning to develop three \nwind power plants north of Bangkok. The proposed \nproject would generate 270MW of electricity and is \nvalued at US$550 million. Another US$400 million, \n270MW wind farm is currently being developed.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ The Foreign Business Act of 1999 has superseded the \nearlier Alien Business Law of 1972. The Act sets out \na number of sectors and activities in which foreign \ncapital is limited to less than a 50% stake. The new \nAct divides foreign ownership into three categories, \n\nranging from ‘absolute prohibition’ in certain sectors \nthrough to sectors requiring ‘administrative’ or \n‘executive approval’.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Thailand ratified the Paris Agreement on \n1 December 2015 and committed to a 20% \nreduction in emissions by 2030. Thailand also \nproposed to commit to a 25% reduction target \nconditional upon receiving international support. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 131\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Ministry of Energy –

the South Pacific Ocean consisting of 86 islands. Many islands are uninhabited and \nsome bear active volcanoes. Prior to independence in 1980, Vanuatu’s islands, then called the New Hebrides, \nwere subject to joint colonial rule by Britain and France. Vanuatu is now a parliamentary democracy with \na unicameral parliament of 52 members. The Indigenous inhabitants of Vanuatu, referred to as ni-Vanuatu \n(meaning ‘of Vanuatu’), are ancestrally Melanesian and Polynesian. A majority of Vanuatu’s population rely on \nsubsistence farming. With over 115 local dialects, Vanuatu possesses the world’s highest linguistic density per \ncapita. In March 2015, Vanuatu was devastated by Cyclone Pam – 90% of housing in Vanuatu’s capital, Port \nVila, was badly damaged and repairs to national infrastructure are ongoing. \n\nVANUATU\n\n132 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 133\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ In rural Vanuatu (where 75% of ni-Vanuatu live), only \n17% of people have access to electricity. The rates of \nelectrification in Vanuatu are therefore low by regional \nstandards. \n\n■■ 95% of the rural population continue to cook with \nbiomass fuels such as wood. Approximately 106 kilo-\ntonnes of fuel wood are consumed yearly. \n\n■■ Vanuatu’s energy mix is significantly reliant on \nimported fuels. According to Vanuatu’s Utilities \nRegulation Authority, in July 2016 diesel combustion \naccounted for 81.11% of electricity generation. \n\n■■ The Department of Energy reported that Vanuatu’s \nconsumption of imported petroleum products will \ngrow by 50% to 2030 if unchecked by effective \nsustainable energy policies. \n\n■■ As at July 2014, the average electricity bill for a \ndomestic consumer in Vanuatu was approximately \nUS$211 per month, which is comparatively high for a \nSouth Pacific island nation. \n\n■■ In March 2015, Cyclone Pam further worsened access \nto electricity. Cyclone Pam caused widespread damage \nto the high and low voltage networks across the Efate \nand Tanna islands. The overall costs of repair work on \nelectricity and water infrastructure were in the vicinity \nof US$2.2 million.\n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ Under the Electricity Supply Act no. 21 of 2000, the \nGovernment can enter into an electricity concession \ncontract with a private entity, which will empower \nthe entity to manufacture and supply electricity in \na specified area, during a specified period. Under \nthe Act, it is an offence for any person other than \nthe concessionaire to generate, distribute or supply \nelectricity in the area of a concession.\n\n■■ The URA Act no. 11 of 2007 establishes the Utilities \nRegulatory Authority and prescribes its powers. The \nAuthority is an economic regulator for water and \nelectricity services in Vanuatu. \n\n■■ The Department of Energy launched the National \nEnergy Road Map in April 2014. The road map is \nVanuatu’s policy framework for achieving affordable, \nsecure, reliable and sustainable energy access for a \nmajority of ni-Vanuatu by 2030. Described as a ‘living \ndocument’ by the Minister for Climate Change and \nEnergy, the plan was revised in June 2016 to expand \non the role of renewable energy and energy efficiency \nin Vanuatu’s policy vision. \n\n■■ Under the road map, changes are planned to the \nGeothermal Energy Act, Petroleum Act, Electricity Supply \nAct, URA Act, and Government Tenders and Contracts \nAct. If implemented, the Utilities Regulatory Authority \nwill be empowered to monitor and regulate liquefied \npetroleum gas prices. Further, petroleum storage will \nbe subject to increased environmental, health, safety \nand quality standards. \n\n■■ The Parliament has passed a Bill to create mandatory \nminimum energy performance standards for electrical \nappliances. \n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ In 2013, Vanuatu established a Ministry for \nClimate Change and Natural Disasters. It includes \nthe Department of Energy, the Department of \nEnvironment and Conservation and the Project \nManagement Unit. \n\n■■ The Department of Energy is responsible for \nadministration of the energy sector and has played a \nkey role in identifying, developing and implementing \nenergy supply projects. \n\n■■ The Project Management Unit works with the \nDepartment of Energy to, among other things, manage \nthe funding of projects by external donors.\n\n■■ Four of Vanuatu’s 86 islands have urban electricity grid \nsystems. They are managed by two private electric \nutilities: the Union Electrique du Vanuatu Limited \n(UNELCO), a subsidiary of French multinational \nEngie, and Vanuatu Utilities & Infrastructure (VUI), \na subsidiary of multinational Pernix Group. \n\n■■ UNELCO manages grids on the Efate, Malekula and \nTanna islands. VUI manages a grid in Luganville (the \nsecond-largest city in Vanuatu) and a village mini-grid \n\n\n\n134 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\non Espiritu Santo Island. UNELCO and VUI operate \nthese systems through concession contracts with the \nGovernment of Vanuatu. \n\n■■ As at July 2014, UNELCO and VUI were respectively \nthe third and fifth most expensive electricity suppliers \nin the Pacific region. \n\n■■ Several nongovernmental organisations are involved \nin implementing energy projects in Vanuatu. They \ninclude the Vanuatu Renewable Energy and Power \nAssociation, the International Union for Conservation \nof Nature and Alternative Communities Trade in \nVanuatu.\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The Government’s target, expressed in the National \nEnergy Road Map, is ambitious – 65% renewable \nenergy in the energy sector by 2020 and 100% by \n2030. The road map recognises that renewable energy \nprojects are a key opportunity to boost the country’s \nunusually low electrification rates and increase overall \nenergy stability. \n\n■■ Data from UNELCO, VUI and the Utilities Regulatory \nAuthority shows that between 2012 and 2015, \nthe proportion of Vanuatu’s energy mix that was \ngenerated from renewable sources increased from \n19% to 29%. \n\n■■ As at July 2016, 11.27% of Vanuatu’s energy generation \ncame from wind power, 6.31% came from hydropower \nand 1.31% came from solar power. \n\n■■ The Department of Energy describes the country’s \nsolar, geothermal, hydro and wind energy sources as \n“substantial” though “not yet utilised”.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ On average, Vanuatu enjoys 2,000 to 2,300 hours of \nsunshine per year. Solar is therefore a high potential \nenergy source. \n\n■■ In 2016, an Abu Dhabi company Masdar, a subsidiary \nof a UAE state-owned enterprise, installed three \ngrid-connected solar photovoltaic plants in Vanuatu, \n\ntotalling 767kW. One component of the project was \nto install ground-mounted and car park photovoltaic \nsystems at Vanuatu’s parliament building. \n\n■■ The Department of Energy estimates that the Masdar \nsolar photovoltaic plants save Vanuatu from importing \n324,000 litres of diesel fuel per year. \n\n■■ The project was delivered under the UAE-Pacific \nPartnership Fund, which disburses US$50 million in \ngrants for renewable energy projects in Pacific island \ncountries.\n\n■■ A further 501kW grid-connected solar photovoltaic \nsystem, located in Undine Bay, opened in May 2016, \nand reportedly supplies electricity to over 300 local \nhouseholds. This project was delivered by Vanuatu \nServices Limited, a subsidiary of UNELCO. \n\n■■ The Government’s highest priority solar projects for \nthe period spanning 2016 to 2018 include installing a \nphotovoltaic micro-grid for the White Sands village \non Tanna Island and delivering the proposed 1,000kW \nEfate grid-connected solar photovoltaic project by \n2018. The latter project is estimated to cost  \nUS$5.6 million and will be delivered by UNELCO. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ The first phase of the Sarakata hydropower station \nwas completed in 1995 with funding from Japanese \nbilateral aid agency, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency. Phase three was completed in 2009, increasing \nthe station’s generation capacity to 1,200kW. VUI has \noperated the station since 2011.\n\n■■ A fourth extension to the Sarakata hydropower \nstation is planned for the period spanning 2018 to \n2021. The Government anticipates that the expansion \nwill cost in the vicinity of US$42.5 million and increase \nthe station’s electricity generation by 600kW. \n\n■■ The Government’s highest priority proposed \nhydropower project is the Brenwe hydropower \nproject, which is planned to be installed on Malekula \nIsland by 2021. The project will likely cost somewhere \nbetween US$5.6 million and US$6.45 million. \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 135\n\n■■ The Brenwe hydropower project will be jointly funded \nby the Asian Development Bank and the Scaling-Up \nRenewable Energy Program, a funding window of the \nClimate Investment Fund. \n\nWind energy\n\n■■ UNELCO and Vergnet Group partnered to deliver the \nDevil’s Point wind farm, which consists of 13 55-metre \nhigh demountable wind turbines, cumulatively \nproducing 3,600kW of electricity. The wind farm, \nwhich commenced operation in 2008, received funding \nfrom the European Investment Bank in the amount of \n4.3 million Euros (approx. US$6 million) It is operated \nby UNELCO. \n\n■■ The National Energy Road Map’s implementation \nplan for the period spanning 2016 to 2030 does not \ndisclose any proposed wind energy projects. \n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Twelve of Vanuatu’s islands are believed to have \ngeothermal potential. \n\n■■ In 2013, the Government issued KUTh Energy \nwith a 30 year exclusive production license for the \ndevelopment of geothermal electricity in the north \nof the Efate Island. KUTh Energy was acquired by \nGeodynamics, an Australian company, in 2014. \n\n■■ The Government is considering the construction of \na geothermal power plant on the island of Efate near \nthe village of Takara. The geothermal energy plant’s \nproposed date of operation remains undecided. \nImplementation of the project is described in the \nNational Energy Road Map as subject to funding and \ncapacity. \n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Vanuatu is a leader in the use of coconut oil as a \nbiofuel to replace diesel fuel. In theory, coconut oil \ncould replace a substantial proportion of the diesel \nfuel currently used. Diesel generators in Port Vila run \non a blend of 20% coconut oil and 80% diesel fuel. \n\n■■ The National Energy Road Map recognises, however, \nthat “[c]oconut oil has a lower energy content \nthan diesel fuel, so more fuel (in litres) is required \n\nto produce the same amount of electricity”. This \nmeans that while the use of coconut oil may assist to \nachieve increased renewable energy generation, it will \nnegatively affect energy efficiency. \n\n■■ In 2016, a 48kW biofuel system was installed on Banks \nIslands and a 144kW biofuel system was installed in \nEast Ambae. Both projects were co-financed by the \nEuropean Union and the Government of Vanuatu. \n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ Given the remote and dispersed nature of Vanuatu’s \nislands, there are high upfront capital costs for \nrenewable energy projects. \n\n■■ The lack of clarity in land ownership and land use \nlaws is a barrier to energy access in Vanuatu and the \ndevelopment of renewable energy projects. \n\n■■ Other challenges include the archipelago’s \nmountainous topography and poorly developed \ninfrastructure.\n\n■■ Further, according to the Department of Energy, there \nis limited scope for large amounts of new renewable \ncapacity unless either electricity demand or grant \nfunding increases. \n\n■■ In the face of these obstacles, Vanuatu’s target of 100% \nrenewable energy by 2030 is highly ambitious. It is \nnot, however, impossible. Vanuatu enjoys an advantage \nover comparable small island nations owing to its \nsuperior geothermal and biomass resources. \n\n■■ The policy proposals presented by the Government \nthrough the National Energy Road Map, including the \nmobilisation of a National Green Energy Fund, aim to \naddress and alleviate the identified challenges. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ The Government has proposed several regulatory \nreforms to assist Vanuatu to increase the proportion \nand reliability of renewable energy in its energy mix.\n\n■■ A policy framework for public private partnerships \nis currently being developed. The underlying aim is \nto accelerate investment in major energy projects, \nincluding renewable energy projects. \n\n\n\n136 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ To mobilise the funds necessary to achieve Vanuatu’s \nrenewable energy target, the Government proposes \nto establish the National Green Energy Fund.\n\n■■ The Government plans to reform import duties, \ntariffs and value-added tax with a view to increasing \nthe importation of renewable energy equipment \nparticularly with respect to solar, wind and biomass \nenergy systems. \n\n■■ Subject to funding and capacity, the Government has \nflagged the possibility of establishing national biofuel \nstandards by 2019. \n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ The likelihood of Vanuatu achieving its renewable \nenergy target of 100% renewable energy by 2030 is \nlikely contingent on the Government obtaining funding \nfrom external sources. \n\n■■ To implement all proposed initiatives in its National \nEnergy Road Map, including the renewable energy \ntarget, the Government estimates that it will require \n“at least US$250 million between 2016 and 2030”. \n\n■■ The Government aims to mobilise at least \nUS$20 million via the National Green Energy Fund \nto extend electricity access. The fund will channel \nexisting and new sources of finance, both at home and \nabroad, to support renewable energy based electricity \nprojects in Vanuatu. It will be managed by a board \nof government officials from the Ministry of Climate \nChange, the Department of Strategic Policy, Planning \nand Aid Coordination, the Department of Finance and \nTreasury and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ As discussed above, the major ongoing or planned \nrenewable energy projects in Vanuatu include the \nfourth extension to the Sarakata hydropower station \n(estimated to cost in the vicinity of US$42.5 million), \nthe construction of the new Brenwe hydropower \nstation (estimated to cost between US$5.6 million and \nUS$6.45 million), the proposed 1,000kW Efate grid-\nconnected solar photovoltaic project (estimated to \ncost US$5.6 million), and the long term possibility of a \ngeothermal power plant on the island of Efate. \n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Foreign direct investment accounted for 2% of \nVanuatu’s GDP in 2014. \n\n■■ The Foreign Investment Promotion Act 1998 regulates \nforeign investment in Vanuatu. The Act establishes the \nVanuatu Investment Promotion Authority. Would-be \nforeign investors must apply to the Authority to attain \nan approval certificate prior to investing in Vanuatu.\n\n■■ There are no income or company taxes for residents \nand no capital gains taxes or withholding taxes \nin general in Vanuatu. There is currently ongoing \nconsultations being carried out in respect of \nintroducing income tax in Vanuatu, but no legislative \nchanges have been implemented as at February 2017.\n\n■■ Australia is one of the highest sources of foreign \ninvestment in Vanuatu. Australian investment totalled \nUS$127 million in 2014 and US$84.5 million in 2015. \n\n■■ There is also significant Chinese investment \nin Vanuatu. The majority of China’s aid in the \nSouth Pacific takes the form of concessional loans \nto fund large infrastructure projects. In 2014, China \nand Vanuatu signed several agreements including the \nEconomic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, by \nwhich China granted Vanuatu close to US$15 million \nin aid (Vt1.67 billion). The Chinese funded the \nconstruction of Vanuatu’s National Convention \nCentre in Port Vila. It cost close to US$14 million \n(Vt1.56 billion) and was built by Chinese company, \nJiangsu Provincial Construction Group Ltd. \n\n■■ Vanuatu has sought to capitalise on the influx of \nChinese tourism in the region. Vanuatu’s Prime \nMinister, the Honourable Charlot Salwai, has stated \nthat he wishes there to be direct flights between \nChina and Vanuatu. Additionally, Vanuatu has \ncapitalised on China’s appetite for ni-Vanuatu fish \nproducts and timber – Vanuatu’s exports to China \nwere worth US$14 million (Vt1.56 billion) in 2015.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 137\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement on 22 April 2016 \nand, subject to receiving adequate funding from external \nsources, committed to transitioning to “close to” 100% \nrenewable energy in the electricity sector by 2030. \n\n■■ Vanuatu’s Intended National Determined Contribution \nstates that in order to achieve the 2030 target, \nVanuatu will develop wind, solar and geothermal \nenergy generation infrastructure and replace fossil \nfuels with coconut oil. Vanuatu states however that \nthe feasibility of implementing its target is conditional \non receiving funding of around US$180 million \n(approx. Vt20 billion) from external sources. \n\n\n\n138 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ Vanuatu’s revised National Energy Road Map (2016 – 2030) –  \nhttp://www.nab.vu/sites/default/files/documents/NERM2016-30.compressed.pdf \n\n■■ The Utilities Regulatory Authority – http://www.ura.gov.vu/ \n\n■■ A database of Vanuatu’s written law provided by the Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute – http://www.paclii.\norg/countries/vu.html \n\n■■ The Vanuatu Investment Promotion Authority – http://www.investvanuatu.org \n\n■■ The Vanuatu Daily Post – http://dailypost.vu/news \n\nREFERENCES\n\n■■ Government of Vanuatu, Updated Vanuatu National Energy Road Map (2016 – 2030), accessed at: \nhttp://www.nab.vu/sites/default/files/documents/NERM2016-30.compressed.pdf\n\n■■ Government of Vanuatu, Vanuatu’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, accessed at: http://www4.unfccc.int/\nndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Vanuatu%20First/VANUATU%20%20INDC%20UNFCCC%20Submission.pdf\n\n■■ Government of Vanuatu (Department of Energy), Energy Sector in Vanuatu –Current Status & Way Forward (Pacific \nUpdate Conference, Suva, 18 to 19 July 2016), accessed at: http://devpolicy.org/Events/2016/Pacific%20Update/\nPlenary%205_Renewable%20Energy/Plenary5_Anthony%20Garae_Vanuatu%20Min%20of%20Climate%20\nChange_2016%20Pacific%20Update%20Conf.pdf \n\n■■ Peter Johnston and Dr Herbert Wade, Inception Report: Consultancy Services to Develop a Renewable Energy-based Off-\ngrid Electrification Master Plan for Remote Islands of Vanuatu along the Example of Four Islands, accessed at: \nhttp://doe.gov.vu/uploads/training/1.%20Inception%20Report%20Vanuatu%20RE%20GIZ%208Apr2016.pdf\n\n■■ Utilities Regulatory Authority, Electricity Market (website), accessed at: \nhttp://www.ura.gov.vu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=38&Itemid=228&lang=en \n\n138 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttp://www.nab.vu/sites/default/files/documents/NERM2016-30.compressed.pdf\nhttp://www.ura.gov.vu/\nhttp://www.paclii.org/countries/vu.html\nhttp://www.paclii.org/countries/vu.html\nhttp://www.investvanuatu.org\nhttp://dailypost.vu/news\nhttp://www.nab.vu/sites/default/files/documents/NERM2016-30.compressed.pdf\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Vanuatu First/VANUATU  INDC UNFCCC Submission.pdf\nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Vanuatu First/VANUATU  INDC UNFCCC Submission.pdf\nhttp://devpolicy.org/Events/2016/Pacific Update/Plenary 5_Renewable Energy/Plenary5_Anthony Garae_Vanuatu Min of Climate Change_2016 Pacific Update Conf.pdf\nhttp://devpolicy.org/Events/2016/Pacific Update/Plenary 5_Renewable Energy/Plenary5_Anthony Garae_Vanuatu Min of Climate Change_2016 Pacific Update Conf.pdf\nhttp://devpolicy.org/Events/2016/Pacific Update/Plenary 5_Renewable Energy/Plenary5_Anthony Garae_Vanuatu Min of Climate Change_2016 Pacific Update Conf.pdf\noads/training/1.

Vietnam has now emerged as one of Asia’s fastest growing economies due largely to the \nDoi Moi reforms which started the country’s transition from a planned economy to a socialist-orientated \nmarket economy. Continued economic liberalisation has resulted in improved living standards, however \npolitical freedoms remain limited. In 2007, Vietnam joined the World Trade Organisation which has further \nencouraged foreign players to explore investment opportunities in the country.\n\nVIETNAM\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 139\n\n\n\n140 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nELECTRICITY INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ Total installed electricity capacity in 2016 was 34GW. \nOf this amount:\n\n – hydropower accounted for 45%; \n\n – natural gas accounted for 22%;\n\n – coal accounted for 29%; and \n\n – oil products accounted for 3%.\n\n■■ Over the last 25 years Vietnam’s economic growth has \nexceeded 6% per year. \n\n■■ Presently, demand for electricity is forecast to \ngrow at 10 to 12% per annum due to advances in \nindustrialisation. This is expected to outstrip installed \ncapacity growth in the near term.\n\n■■ Capacity shortfalls will be bridged by importing \nelectricity from Laos through upgraded transmission \ngrids being installed over the next four years.\n\n■■ Vietnam’s energy mix is set to change over the next \n15 years, with the growth in coal power surpassing the \ngrowth in renewable energy sources. In March 2016, \nthe Government issued the revised 7th Power \nDevelopment Plan for 2011 to 2030 (Revised PDP 7) \nand placed a stronger emphasis on renewable energy. \nUnder the Revised PDP 7, coal is expected to account \nfor 53.2% of the nation’s power generation by 2030, \nwith renewables accounting for 10.7% of the energy \nmix by that time. \n\n■■ It was not until June 2005 that the national power \ngrid reached all of Vietnam’s provinces. Around \n66% of Vietnam’s population lives in rural areas, \nyet the Government has achieved a country-wide \nelectrification rate of 99%.\n\n■■ Vietnam experiences relatively frequent power \nshortages and blackouts, particularly in rural areas \nwhere more than 20 power outages lasting longer \nthan five minutes occurred in 2013. The nation is \nranked 113 out of 144 countries for power reliability. \n\nElectricity laws\n\n■■ The Law on Electricity of 2004, as subsequently \namended by Law 24/2012/QH13 of 2012 (Law on \nElectricity) outlines the major principles for the \n\nestablishment of the power market in Vietnam. It is \nthe first law to regulate the country’s energy sector. \nThe Law on Electricity aims to stimulate development \nand diversify forms of investment in the energy \nsector and encourage economical use of electricity. \nIt introduced the move towards a competitive \nelectricity market.\n\n■■ Decision 1208/QD-TTg (PDP 7) dated 21 July 2011, \namended by (Decision 428/QD-TTg) of 18 March 2016 \nimplements the above-mentioned Revised PDP 7.\n\n■■ Decision 26/2006/QD-TTg dated 26 January 2006, \nlater revised by Decision 63/2013/QD-TTg dated \n8 November 2013 promotes the establishment of a \ncompetitive electricity market to attract investment. \nThe first phase of the project was completed in \n2016, which saw electricity generation privatised, but \nElectricity Vietnam (EVN) remains the sole purchaser \nand distributor of electricity. The pilot phase for a fully \ncompetitive market will take place over the next five \nyears, and by the end of 2023, Vietnam aims to be in \na position to implement a fully competitive market at \nthe retail level.\n\nGeneration, distribution and transmission\n\n■■ The electricity market in Vietnam is currently \nmonopolistic. The state-owned enterprise EVN is the \nmajor producer and distributor of electricity. EVN \naccounted for about 68% of the country’s installed \ncapacity in 2009.\n\n■■ The country is moving towards a competitive \nelectricity production model, with regulations \non a competitive wholesale market scheduled for \ncompletion in early 2017, after which EVN will no \nlonger be the single buyer in the generation market. \n\n■■ Two notable power stations that are operating in \nVietnam are the coal-powered Quang Ninh Power \nStation (1,200MW) and the hydropower Hoa Binh \nDam (1,920MW). Together these power plants make \nup around 10% of the country’s installed capacity.\n\n■■ The Vietnamese Government has stated that it is \nfocused on updating the electricity grid so that all \nrural households will have electricity by 2020.\n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 141\n\nRENEWABLES INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n■■ The Revised PDP 7 gives priority to the development \nof renewable energy as a source of electricity. The \npercentage of electricity generated from renewable \nresources is expected to increase from 2% in 2010, \nto 7% of total electricity production in 2020 and 10% \nin 2030.\n\n■■ Vietnam’s first nuclear power plant was set to come \nonline in 2028 and to produce about 5.7% of the \nnation’s electricity. However, in November 2016, the \nNational Assembly suspended the nuclear power \nplant project (Resolution 31/2016/QH14), reportedly \ndue to “economic reasons and not because of any \ntechnological considerations”. In the same Resolution, \nthe National Assembly has instructed the Government \nto focus on developing new sources of renewable \nenergy and other safe, efficient sources of energy, in \norder to protect the environment.\n\n■■ Total wind power capacity is expected to increase \nfrom its current level of almost 0% to 0.8% by 2020 \nand 2.1% by 2030 of total electricity supply, while the \nRevised PDP 7 envisages that wind power will account \nfor about 20% of total renewables capacity. \n\n■■ Biomass power and power co-generation at sugar \nplants are expected to make up 1% of installed \ncapacity by 2020 and 2.1% by 2030.\n\n■■ The Renewable Energy Development Project, which \nwas launched by the World Bank in 2002, serves as \nthe framework for renewable sector development. \nIts aim is for large-scale development of renewable \nprojects to deliver rural electrification.\n\n■■ Diversification and reduction of Vietnam’s reliance \non imported fossil fuels have been key themes within \ngovernment renewable energy policies, however in the \nmedium term the country’s reliance on coal electricity \nproduction will likely increase as a percentage of total \nproduction. After 2025, energy sourced from fossil \nfuels will likely begin to fall as a percentage of total \nenergy production. \n\nHydropower\n\n■■ Vietnam has 2,400 rivers of 10km or longer, which \nconfers a high potential for small and large-scale \nhydropower production. Indeed, hydropower already \ncontributes nearly half of the country’s energy supply.\n\n■■ The Son La Dam (discussed below) in North Vietnam \nis the country’s largest electricity generator.\n\n■■ There are a number of hydropower plants either \nunder construction or recently commissioned, \nincluding the Son La Project.\n\n■■ Vietnam’s theoretical potential for hydropower \ncapacity is estimated at over 10,000MW.\n\nWind energy\n\n■■ Vietnam’s extensive coastline and wind speeds \naveraging between 6 to 8m/s in coastal regions means \nthe country is moderately suited to wind energy \nproduction. Unfortunately the technical capacity of \nthe nation is far less than the theoretical potential due \nto systematic limitations.\n\n■■ Currently there are over 65 wind projects at various \nstages of development, each with a power generation \nrange from 6MW to 150MW.\n\nSolar energy\n\n■■ Vietnam has approximately 2,000 to 2,500 hours of \nsunshine per year. Southern Vietnam is particularly \nsuited to solar energy production due to the high \nlevels of solar radiation. By 2030, Vietnam hopes to \nproduce 12GW of solar energy annually. \n\n■■ Unfortunately the mountainous terrain of Vietnam \nmakes about one-third of the country unsuitable for \nsolar photovoltaic power generation. \n\n■■ Around 5,000 sites around the country have stand-\nalone solar photovoltaic systems. Due to the high \ncost of solar power in Vietnam, it is generally only \neconomically feasible in rural areas.\n\n\n\n142 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\n■■ The Solar Laboratory of Vietnam Science Institute, the \nInstitute of Energy and the Renewable Energy Centre \nare particularly active in the solar energy space in \nVietnam.\n\nGeothermal energy\n\n■■ Vietnam has over 300 hot streams, with temperatures \nranging from 30 to 148°C.\n\n■■ It is estimated that 400MW of electricity could be \nproduced with geothermal energy by 2020.\n\nBiomass/biogas energy\n\n■■ Biomass, including wood fuel and agricultural residues \n(rice husk, rice straw, coffee husk and bagasse), is \ncommonly used in rural areas as home energy. \n\n■■ The waste from the large livestock population in \nVietnam has the potential to provide significant \nbiogas energy resources to the nation. Over 114,000 \nhousehold biodigesters have been installed throughout \nVietnam. \n\nOcean energy\n\n■■ There are no detailed assessments of ocean energy \npotential in Vietnam but the country has a long \ncoastline and a number of offshore islands.\n\nCURRENT ISSUES IN THE RENEWABLES \nINDUSTRY\n\n■■ The privatisation of the electricity market has been \na priority for the Government. EVN’s influence in \nthe market has been gradually diminishing, notably \nin 2016 when the generation sector was privatised. \nThe Government aims to have a fully competitive \nmarket at the retail level by 2023.\n\n■■ The need to rapidly increase electricity capacity \nmeans that in the medium term, the Vietnamese \nGovernment has increased the focus on coal power as \ndemonstrated in the revisions to the PDP 7.\n\n■■ Due to a lack of feed-in tariffs, solar energy \nproduction is currently minimal. \n\n■■ The nation’s reliance on hydropower has caused \nwidespread deforestation and concerns about unsafe \ndam construction. Additionally it is expected that \nclimate change will have a significant impact on \nVietnam’s management of water resources including \ntheir hydropower production which may pose \na challenge to development in the hydroelectric \nindustry. \n\nRENEWABLES LAWS\n\n■■ There is currently no ‘renewable energy act’ or \ndesignated renewable energy regulation. A study \nconducted in 2012 identified the lack of clear legal \nframework on renewable energy as a key hindrance to \nrenewable energy development in Vietnam.\n\n■■ The Law on Energy Efficiency and Conservation \n50/2010/QH12 took effect in 2011 and has helped \nto establish a framework for meeting longer-term \nrenewable energy development targets. \n\n■■ The Electricity Law 28/2004/QH11, as amended by \nLaw 24/2012/QH13, outlines the need for investment \nincentives in renewable energy.\n\n■■ Decree 21/2011/ND-CP dated 29 March 2011 on energy \nsavings and the efficient use of energy, introduces a \nraft of energy-saving measures, particularly for large \nconsumers of electricity.\n\n■■ Decision 37/2011/QD-TTg dated 29 June 2011 provides a \nfeed-in tariff mechanism to support the development \nof wind power projects in Vietnam (see below).\n\n■■ Decree 19/2015/ND-CP dated 14 February 2015 \nprovides for certain regulations on incentives and \nsupports for environmental protection activities and \nrenewable energy.\n\nGOVERNMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS\n\n■■ Vietnam has a feed-in-tariff which was introduced by \nthe Ministry of Finance in 2012. It is generally offered to \nwind power generation at US$0.078 per kWh (under \n\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 143\n\nDecision 37/2011/QD-TTg of 29 June 2011), however \nthere is a specific case for Bac Lieu Wind Power Project \nwhich enjoys a feed-in tariff of US$0.098 per kWh. This \nfeed-in tariff has been effective in promoting investment \nin wind projects.\n\n■■ The Vietnamese Prime Minister approved Decision \nNo. 11/2017/QD-TTg dated 11 April 2017, which \nestablished a solar feed-in tariff. The rate is \ncompetitive by regional standards (about US$0.0934 \nper kWh) and applies to certain on-grid projects.\n\n■■ Many renewable energy projects fall into the \ncategories of ‘encouraged sectors’ or ‘encouraged \nindustries’ which enjoy reduced corporate tax rates \nand accelerated depreciation. \n\nMAJOR PROJECTS/COMPANIES\n\n■■ The Bac Lieu Wind Farm (99.2MW) is the first wind farm \nto be developed in the Mekong Delta region, and it is \nAsia’s first offshore wind farm. It is now fully operational \nand has an operational life of 22 years. In the next stage \nof the project, 71 more turbines will be constructed, \nwith an operational date at the end of 2018. \n\n■■ The Phu Cuong wind project located in the Soc Trang \nProvince, due to reach financial close in 2018, will have \na capacity of 150 to 200MW. \n\n■■ The Son La hydropower plant, which is the largest \nhydropower plant ever built in Vietnam, and cost \nover US$3.2 billion, was officially put into operation \nin December 2012, three years ahead of schedule. \n\nIts installed capacity is approximately 2.4GW and will \nalso increase the capacity of the Hao Binh hydropower \nstation (which is downstream). The Son La project is \nstill the largest power plant in Vietnam. It required the \ndisplacement of approximately 91,000 people.\n\n■■ The Dong Nai hydropower plant in the Lam Dong \nprovince comprises around 100 major plants and \nenterprises. The power plant is owned by EVN and \ngenerates around 520MW of electricity.\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT/OWNERSHIP\n\n■■ Through the Revised PDP 7, foreign investment has \nbeen encouraged through additional land incentives, \nimport tax exemptions and corporate income tax \nreductions. Foreign investment in Vietnam has begun \nto increase in the past eight years due to the country’s \ncentral geographic position, growing consumer \nmarket and relatively stable political climate. Vietnam \nnow sustains over US$12 billion of foreign direct \ninvestment per year.\n\n■■ There is no policy discrimination against foreign \ninvestors in Vietnam, and the licencing requirements \nfor foreigners are in certain cases more favourable \nthan they are for locals.\n\nUNFCCC – PARIS COMMITMENTS AND \nBEYOND\n\n■■ Vietnam ratified the Paris Agreement on \n3 November 2016 and committed to reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 8% by 2030.\n\n\n\n144 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nRELEVANT WEBSITES\n\n■■ The Asian Development Bank Report on Vietnam’s energy sector – https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/\ninstitutional-document/178616/vie-energy-road-map.pdf \n\n■■ Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT), Vietnam Renewable Energy development project to 2030 with outlook to 2050, \naccessed at: http://www.vn.undp.org/content/dam/vietnam/docs/Publications/Mr%20Thuc.pdf\n\nREFERENCES \n\n■■ Asian Development Bank, Vietnam, Energy Sector, Assessment Strategy and Roadmap, accessed at: \nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/178616/vie-energy-road-map.pdf\n\n■■ Vietnam Briefing, Industry Spotlight: Vietnam’s Renewable Energy Market, accessed at: http://www.vietnam-briefing.\ncom/news/industry-spotlight-vietnams-renewable-energy-market.html/ \n\n■■ Reegle, Country Energy Profile: Vietnam, accessed at: http://www.reegle.info/countries/vietnam-energyprofile/VN \n\n144 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/178616/vie-energy-road-map.pdf\nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/178616/vie-energy-road-map.pdf\nhttp://www.vn.undp.org/content/dam/vietnam/docs/Publications/Mr Thuc.pdf\nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/178616/vie-energy-road-map.pdf\nhttp://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/industry-spotlight-vietnams-renewable-energy-market.html/\nhttp://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/industry-spotlight-vietnams-renewable-energy-market.html/\nhttp://www.reegle.info/countries/vietnam-energyprofile/VN\n\n\nwww.dlapiper.com | 145\n\nFEED-IN TARIFF TABLE\n\nHydropower Wind Solar Biomass\n\nChina\n\nRMB/kWh No fixed rate 0.47 to 0.601 0.65 to 0.852 0.75\n\nUS$/kWh No fixed rate 0.068 to 0.087 0.094 to 0.123 0.109\n\nIndonesia3\n\nIDR/kWh 1,597.94 to 1,917.62\nYet to be \nintroduced \n\n1,930.94 to 3,329.19 1,438.21 to 2,130.68\n\nUS$/kWh 0.12 to 0.1444\nYet to be \nintroduced \n\n0.145 to 0.25 0.1080 to 0.16 \n\nJapan5\n\nJPY/kWh 14 to 346 22 to 557 24 to 35 13 to 408\n\nUS$/kWh 0.126 to 0.306 0.198 to 0.495 0.216 to 0.315 0.117 to 0.36\n\nMalaysia9\n\nMYR/kWh 0.24 to 0.26\nYet to be \nintroduced\n\n0.3538 to 0.7424 0.2687 to 0.3085\n\nUS$/kWh 0.05 to 0.06\nYet to be \nintroduced\n\n0.08 to 0.17 0.06 to 0.07\n\nMongolia\n\nMNT/kWh 110.362 to 147.149 196.199 to 232.986 367.872 to 441.447\nYet to be \nintroduced\n\n1  A feed-in tariff for offshore wind has also been introduced (0.75 to 0.85). \n\n2  The feed-in tariff for Tibet Autonomous Region is 1.05. \n\n3   All Indonesian feed-in-tariff rates (excluding solar) are multiplied by a location factor.

They recommended that feed-in tariffs be phased \nout and replaced by other incentive-based instruments such as feed-in premiums. They advised that feed-in tariffs do not \nencourage active market participation, and should be removed to ensure competitiveness in the renewables market. \n\nAs a result, a number of EU member States have been phasing out their feed-in tariff schemes, often replacing them with \nfeed-in premiums or auctions. Germany replaced their feed-in tariff scheme with an auction system used to determine the \nreference value of renewable energy. A market premium is also offered to producers of renewable energy. Norway has \nintroduced a shared subsidy scheme with Sweden, through the issuance of electricity certificates to producers which can be \nsold to suppliers in the electricity certificates market.35 This Europe-wide move away from feed-in tariff schemes appears to \nbe a reaction to the Commission’s recommendations.36\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/com_2013_public_intervention_swd04_en.pdf\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/com_2013_public_intervention_swd04_en.pdf\nhttps://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2013/10/norway-taxes-and-incentives.html\nhttp://reneweconomy.com.au/germany-confirms-end-to-renewable-energy-feed-in-tariffs-97024/\n\n\n148 | Renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nDOING BUSINESS REPORT\n\nThe World Bank Group’s annual Doing Business report “measures aspects of business regulation affecting domestic small and \nmedium-size firms defined based on standardised case scenarios and located in the largest business city of each economy”. \nThe criteria used in the report include: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering \nproperty, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving \ninsolvency and labour market regulation.
