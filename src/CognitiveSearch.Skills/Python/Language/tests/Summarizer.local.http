Against the backdrop of the financial crisis* a decade earlier (which exacerbated tensions between the haves and the have nots) and the simultaneous eruption of protests* connected to the Black Lives Matter movement (which further emphasized inequality), these factors may have contributed to heightened sensitivities and a growing social conscience. Thus a large part of the US sample tend to increasingly downplay their wealth in public (hence the preponderance of Quiet Conservatives and Discreet Achievers in the sample as opposed to Extravagant Attention-Seekers). • The recent political change to a Democrat Administration in control of all three branches of government (White House, Congress and Senate) and reputedly hostage to what American conservatives call the „radical left“, appears to have raised some concerns that the increased tax burden may lead to a decline in affordability among HNWIs, especially when it comes to luxury products. • There is also a tendency in USA to regard European culture and brands as „exotic“ and therefore more appealing and more exclusive, especially for luxury products from long-established manufacturers who can boast a unique brand heritage. Covid is taking everybody home so everybody is over-zealous at home. They can’t express themselves outside so they’re doing it through Zoom and social media and they’re lying. (US, m, older) * NB: neither of these events were mentioned by any of the respondents Some people look at it like “How dare you spend your money on something like that when so many don’t have food on their table”. I do think about that when I’m in the car. (US, f, older) Experiences may change because of the unstable political environment. Maybe more taxes, I may not be able to do what I am used to …affordability is getting smaller. (US, m, older)",
