This advanced architecture  will  achieve cloud control modules that will allow OEM’s to offer varied connected services under the  Feature  on Demand business model.\r\nLow Medium High\r\n5G impact: OTA updates are the main drivers for the OEM’s to push automatic updates faster into the in-vehicle infotainment system and also to other functionality in the car. Implementation and wider use of 5G will have an aggressive impact on the number of features that are able to be offered as On-demand car technology by the OEM’s.\r\nLow Medium High\r\nRegion Specific & Embedded platform: Feature on Demand market is now more specific to North America & Europe regions, since both these market have maximum OEM’s offering embedded connectivity which can be used to introduce more services under FoD.\r\nMedium High High\r\nConsumer drive: Most of the subscription bundle offered by OEM’s have many services that are not used by the customers regularly. One reason why consumers may also drive the FoD market is that it gives them an opportunity to activate or deactivate a particular service at their convenience. The willingness to pay for one particular service rather than  a package  will also attract consumers  try this  business  model.\r\nLow Medium High\r\nGrowth Drivers for Feature on Demand Market\r\nFeature on Demand Market : Key Growth Drivers, North America & Europe, 2021-2025\r\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\r\nPC09 - Draft 25\r\nRestraint 1–2 Years 3–4 Years 5–6 Years\r\nDearth of regulations: Tight regulations on vehicles for safety and environmental reasons on various functionality in many countries across the globe acts as an hindrance for offering certain functions under FoD, for example:- Remote start is illegal in most of the countries.\r\nHigh Medium Medium\r\nConsumer willingness to pay: With implementation of more 5G enabled embedded connectivity by OEM’s in vehicles , the expense would be passed on to the end customer thus by increasing the vehicle retail price and also by charging more on the subscription based models. This might have an negative impact on the customer willingness to pay accordingly.\r\nHigh High Medium\r\nVehicle/Consumer data security: FoD will open a wide range of digital payments made by customers either to the OEM itself or to the 3rd party through which the service has been availed.

The electric vehicle and the charging station will have their own digital wallet. Payments between these wallets happen automatically after the vehicle is fully charged. No human intervention required. Similarly, maintenance, repair and insurance services can be paid using digital wallets.\r\n• Automakers have to conduct pilots to determine how blockchain & security can be implemented for payments in vehicles\r\nPayment model with distributed ledger technology & cryptocurrency\r\nSource: DXC, Frost & Sullivan\r\nPC09 - Draft 49\r\nWhat will be the Future of In-Vehicle Payments?

This could result in potential legal gray areas for dealers when reselling cars on what feature is on-going, permanent or to be subscribed\r\nSafety based features: An effective and well-functioning safety system could be deactivated once subscription period ends, even when customer has paid huge upfront costs for the integration of hardware into the vehicle. Regulatory best practices for safety based features in cars should be clearly defined\r\nCybersecurity will be critical for FoD: Accessing customer confidential data to process in-vehicle payments and activating features over-the-air will require strong security mechanisms to avoid future liability issues. Regulatory expectations can further elevate the role of effective data management\r\nIn-car payments are not regulated: In-car payments will be an enabler and pre-requisite for implementing FoD.

Draft 91\r\nGrowth Opportunity 1: Feature on Demand to generate renewed interest for customers in Connected services\r\n• The ability of an automaker to retain customers will be determined by how it implements creative packaging options at the point of purchase of a vehicle and subsequent aftersales subscriptions via shipments.\r\n• With the expansion of telematics embedded in automobiles and more manufacturers finding monetization opportunities, market models are radically changing.\r\n• Offering on-demand services as a new revenue source and recurring sales is one of the newer business models.\r\n• Not only are automakers looking to unbundle service packages into a-la-carte options to market them separately on a pay-per-use basis with pre-installed hardware capabilities, but they are also looking to unbundle service packages into a-la-carte options to sell them separately on a pay-per-use model with pre-installed hardware capabilities.\r\n• According to our customer research, more than 40% of all drivers plan to use FoD and are willing to pay a premium for at least one feature.\r\n• F&S forecasts that automakers offering feature-on-demand have a global sales capacity of up to $15 billion.\r\nContext and Definition Call to Action\r\n• The shift in customer needs has a significant impact on such a transition, and not only premium automakers, but also volume automakers, must concentrate their energies on FoD rather than incremental connected service platform updates.\r\n• Automakers must capitalize on the new sales potential, which is in the billions of dollars, as this is an excellent opportunity for them to move from vehicle seller to content provider.\r\n• Tier-I suppliers must simultaneously transform their businesses to provide not only hardware solutions, but also software solutions, as well as assist automakers in decoupling the software and offering support for the launch of FoD on vehicles.\r\n• The aim for any new model to be released in the next two to three years should be to allow such functionality, if not to offer software updates to enable features, then to offer software updates to enable functions.\r\n• While the features are available, concurrent software creation to provide functions such as body electronics, powertrain, autonomous modes, and so on can be pursued and launched later during the vehicle's functional life.\r\n91\r\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\r\nPC09 -

Draft 93\r\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\r\nGrowth Opportunity 2: Feature on Demand to drive monetization opportunities for OEM’s\r\n• Automakers  should have a right pricing strategy by creating a feasible pricing model  that vary from customer to customer and also  across  different vehicle segments.\r\n• Vehicles  generate a lot of additional info on  customer need & behavior, vehicle  data, traffic info and many other data that can be used by 3rd party companies  or by the OEM itself to  offer their customers with relevant data based products.\r\n• Insurance based companies use  vehicle data to offer certain plans  that are customized for a particular customer. Volvo is the only OEM currently which offers Insurance On-demand for certain number of days.\r\n• With global call for electrification of all vehicles , Automakers have an opportunity to introduce newer electric vehicles  that would also  have the option of introducing more and more connected services  under the FoD market, since electric vehicles are adapted to the new vehicle architecture.\r\n• Intelligent pricing model  will allow the OEM’s to marginally increase their revenue under FoD business model.\r\nContext and Definition Call to Action\r\n• Factors that evaluate the Customer Willingness  to pay for a particular function in advance would  help the automakers to decide on the right pricing strategy.\r\n• Automakers can themselves use tons of data generated from the vehicle  to design a product, based on the personalization experience of the customer or also  transfer the data to 3rd party and hence monetize the vehicle data available.\r\n• The concept of Pay as you drive can be offered by insurance companies if the OEM shares the trip data using telematics system of a particular customer and thus the insurance company can adapt a flexible premium based on the customer driving behavior.\r\n• Subscription offered for a feature/function should be  more evenly distributed for a longer term, rather than generating a high revenue only for couple of years.\r\n• For example, a function offered for $100 for 3 years should be offered with “pay as you use “option for $1/day and even if  a customer activate s this  function for only 2 days in a week, the net amount at the end of 3 years will be around $312 approx. which is more than double the previous revenue.\r\nPC09 - Draft 94\r\nGrowth Opportunity 3: Feature on Demand to drive opportunities for various payment gateways\r\nFrost & Sullivan has identified 10 Growth Processes that serve as levers for determining and evaluating new Growth Opportunities.\r\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\r\n2 Years\r\nRelevant Industries for this Growth Opportunity\r\nIndustrial Automation\r\nEnvironmental\r\nOil & Gas\r\nBuilding Technologies\r\nConsumer Electronics\r\nConsumer Mobility\r\nCommercial Mobility\r\nChemicals & Materials\r\nAg.,  Food & Nutrition\r\nTest & Measurement\r\nAerospace\r\nDefense\r\nSecurity\r\nCommunications Tech\r\nInformation Tech\r\nPharma & Biotech\r\nAdvanced Medtech\r\nFintech\r\nApplicable Regions\r\nNorth America\r\nLatin America\r\nCentral/Eastern\r\nEurope\r\nWestern Europe\r\nAfrica\r\nAsia-Pacific\r\nOpp. Size in 5 Years\r\nTimeline for Action\r\nBase Year 2020\r\nCustomer & Branding\r\nDistribution Channel\r\nGeographic Expansion\r\nVertical Market Expansion\r\nCompetitive Strategy\r\nProduct Development\r\nMerger & Acquisition Product Launch Technology & IP\r\nGrowth Processes\r\nStrategic Partnering\r\n$0.16 B -\r\n$4.04 B\r\nNote: Revenue Opp. Size  for Total Addressable FoD Market Revenue by Services\r\nPC09 - Draft 95\r\nSource: Frost & Sullivan\r\nGrowth Opportunity 3: Feature on Demand to drive opportunities for various payment gateways\r\n• Feature on Demand requires payment to be done at the behest of the customer request, irrespective of the geography or any technological hindrance.\r\n• 3rd party payment apps will garner more opportunities ,as only premium OEM’s  might invest in developing their own payment gateway, whereas volume OEM’s have to highly depend on the 3Rd party payment apps.\r\n• Automakers have the responsibility of assuring security and compliance throughout the entire payment process. Protecting customer data should be its first priority.\r\n• OEM’s should also plan to offer other local payment methods for the convenience of the customer.\r\n• Several Fintech companies can take advantage of the growing trend in automotive domain with respect to digital payments for services and also for On-demand functions.\r\n• The revenue from payment provider can be shared between the automaker and the 3rd party involved making a win-win situation for both sides.\r\nContext and Definition Call to Action\r\n• Feature on Demand will open doors for OEM’s either to develop their own in-house payment gateway or to tie up with existing payment gateways in the respective region.\r\n• 3rd party payment apps have an edge over OEM in-house payments as they not only offer wide range of services under the app, but also have  a strong existing customer portfolio under their database. Also local payment apps always have an edge over the outsiders in any part of the world.\r\n• AudiPay has  been introduced by Audi for payments for FoD and also for other services. The customer can pay for the digital services using their stored credit cards. Audi also assures a secure connection for the customer under a global group payments  provider VW payments.\r\n• Premium OEM’s will also follow the payment methodology adopted by Audi in future for smooth customer service\r\n• Volume OEM’s can tie up with 3rd party payments with a good revenue sharing model.\r\nPC09 - Draft 96\r\nNext Steps\r\nPC09 - Draft 97\r\nYour Next Steps\r\n3\r\nTake the Growth Pipeline\r\nDiagnostic™\r\nParticipate in a customized Growth\r\nPipeline Dialog™\r\nDecide on Growth Pipeline Audit™ or GPaaS™ Solution\r\nEngage in a deep dive discussion with our consulting team to\r\nunderstand new growth opportunities\r\nConnect with your Frost & Sullivan consultant to embark on the growth\r\njourney\r\n1 2 3 Have your Growth Team\r\nexecutives take the online survey for a high-level\r\ndiagnostic on your growth capabilities\r\nPC09 - Draft 98\r\nWhy Frost, Why Now?\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\nCOVERAGE\r\nANALYTICS\r\nBEST PRACTICES\r\n• 60 years of proven global experience • Trusted partner of Investors, corporates,\r\n& governments\r\n• Industry convergence through comprehensive coverage\r\n• Global footprint to match clients’ needs\r\n• Innovation Generator™ driving six analytical perspectives\r\n• Proprietary growth tools & frameworks\r\n• Growth Pipeline Engine™ and Companies to Action™\r\n• Ten Growth Processes: best practices foundation\r\nOur Expertise\r\n• FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL: Maximized through collaboration\r\n• GROWTH PIPELINE: Continuous flow of growth opportunities\r\n• GROWTH STRATEGIES: Proven best\r\npractices\r\n• INNOVATION CULTURE: Optimized customer experience\r\n• ROI & MARGIN: Implementation excellence\r\n• TRANSFORMATIONAL GROWTH: Industry leadership\r\nClient Impact\r\nPC09 - Draft 99\r\nLegal Disclaimer\r\n© 2020 Frost & Sullivan.
